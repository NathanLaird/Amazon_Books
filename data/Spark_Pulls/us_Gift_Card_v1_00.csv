Something is definitely not right here.<br />I have had so many good experiences with eGift cards until this one.  I bought 4 email gift cards in 1 order and they were all sent correctly to 4 recipients' emails.  Two of them were redeemed within a day and I got notified via email as such.  After almost 3 months, I was browsing my other orders and saw the other two were redeemed by an email address that I didn't recognize.  I sent an inquiry to Amazon.com.  After 10 emails, 1 phone call and 1 chat 4 weeks later, amazon.com asked me to file a claim through my credit card company that paid for the gift cards.<br />My initial inquiries via emails were quite frustrating as each email was responded by different support person who obviously didn't read previous emails.  After two days of these emails, I called amazon.com. The support person was helpful and told me name of the amazon customer who redeemed the two gift cards.  Since I didn't know the amazon customer who redeemed the gift cards and I never resent those gift cards to an email address different from the intended recipients, it was clear that the two gift cards were fraudulently sent and redeemed.  They were going to investigate this case, so I thought.  After 2 weeks of not hearing back from amazon.com, I followed up with the most recent email from 2 weeks prior.  They came back with they will contact me when they finish their investigation.  I didn't hear back from them for another 2 weeks, so I sent another followup email.  This time, they came back with you need to go through your credit card company to file a claim.  It was clear I wasted weeks corresponding with amazon.com thinking they are doing something, but it is clear now all they are doing is dragging this out to frustrate their customers.  Just because I feel I need to do the right thing, I filed a claim with my credit card company today and I am posting this review.<br />So, why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were resent to another email?  Why didn't I get an email when those two gift cards were redeemed?

I have placed many orders but I have been extremely disappointed in your policy of not letting me purchase gift cards with my tax refund.  The main reason I sent you my tax refund was so I could purchase many gift cards for my relatives, friends, and neighbors.  I can understand not letting someone use a gift card that someone has given them to purchase a gift card for someone else but my gift card is not something someone has given me; IT IS MY OWN MONEY which I authorized the IRS to send to Amazon.  I think you should have a  different category for peoples own money and allow them to buy gift cards.  If I had been allowed to buy gift cards with my tax refund money, I would have introduced Amazon to at least 20 new customers this year; I know that is not many but I bet I am not the only one who sent you their tax refund.  I cannot give gift cards more than one star until you allow your customers to buy gift cards with their own money which they have already sent to Amazon.",16437.0

The TV was listed 400 dollars cheaper than normal so I had to buy it immediately. Every minute, I checked my email for the giftcard delivery, 5 minutes passed and I still did not receive it. I knew something was odd. At this time, I had a choice: either buy the TV and be stuck with a 2,000 giftcard that may be processed hours later or wait for the giftcard. I was afraid of the refund policy on giftcards so I waited. The wait turned to a 14 hour wait. Amazon finally responded telling me the giftcard was unauthorized activity and canceled my order. GREAT, no problem right? Well, the TV is now listed at normal price so I loss out on a 400 dollar savings!<br /><br />My lesson to you is Amazon is not dependable if you want to buy and use a giftcard on a hot item. And they won't do anything about it.<br /><br />Why Amazon gets a 1 star?

They added a nice premium to whatever you chose to have put into the gift card. So my wife and I looked at what we spent last year with our TWO amazon accounts and found that we spent more than $2000, much of it on gift cards for birthdays and holidays, but also lots on diapers and other subscription services that come through my wife's account. So I signed up for ~$2000 of my return to go to an Amazon card and figured we would split it between our accounts.<br /><br />Since I do the taxes, it was easiest to have it sent to me. When I got it I applied it to my account, used $40 of it to buy my daughter a couple things, and then went to buy a large gift card for my wife. That's when I discovered the restriction that says you cannot purchase gift cards with gift cards. What a terrible restriction! Not only cannot I not use any of this money toward the hundreds of dollars of gift cards we will probably buy this year, I can't get any of the money to my wife's account, which accounts for 2/3 of our spending!<br /><br />Amazon customer support is unable to help me. They say that since I used some of the balance, none of it can be transferred. This is a disaster for me. At least if the balance was on my wife's account I could log in and make my purchases with her account, but with it on my account it means we have to rebuild all our subscription purchases, cancel our prime account and buy a new one with mine, etc. it would still be a pain to buy each other gifts since my purchases for her would send her email notifications, but it would be better than the current situation.<br /><br />If I had known of these restrictions I would have gotten a dramatically smaller balance and I would have applied it to my wife's account instead of my own.",16184.0

Then the creme de la creme came when I found out after all of these emails back and forth, it really did not matter as there was absolutely no writing inside the gift cards.

When I tried to use it to buy my school book I couldn't because the code did not work.  I tried it again and it still did not work so I called Amazon Customer Service.  After talking to someone (who was easy to understand) for ten minutes she hung up on me.  Then I called back and got a lady with a very heavy accent who was super hard to understand.  I talked to this lady for over 30 minutes and had to deal with her asking the same questions over and over and not helping me at all.  I finally asked for a manager and she told me she will let him know that I want to speak to him.  After 5 minutes on hold she came back to the phone without the manager!  She told me he was busy and she did the best she could to help me and was about to hang up on me! I told her that I needed to speak to the manager and I was willing to wait.  She put me back on hold and about 2 minutes later the manager came to the phone.  After talking to the manager who did nothing to help; he told me he was going to forward this information on to the gift card department by email and they would get back to me within 24 hours.  At this point I learned the manager was just as unless as the employee in customer service and nothing was going to get done with them.  So a few hours later I got an email from the gift card department and it said ....We would best be able to help you if you call our customer service line.  ....ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!  At this point, I was pissed so I waited a few hours to reply in order to gather my thoughts and calm down.  About 5 hours after the gift card department replied the manager replied tell me that he sent my request and they would get back to me within 1-2 business days --- This was different information then what he told me on the phone and a delayed reply since the gift card department had replied already.  ....This story is getting too long ...so long story short after talking on the phone thenext day to two more people someone finally worked out it out; it was almost not worth the 30 dollars!

I called Amazon customer service and they told me they did not show any evidence that I had purchased these gift cards (even though my bank card stated I paid for them) and they would have to contact a &#34;gift card&#34; representative to figure the situation out and it could take up to 3 business days. Since then I have talked to numerous customer service representatives, of all whom I could not understand fully because they were based out of the country and it wasn't until the last person I talked with, that she said at any point I could have asked for an American based representative, even though I had asked numerous times to speak with someone who spoke better English, I never got anyone.

We called them on Christmas Eve and were told the item was sitting at a location about 20 minutes away. We were given the option of picking it up which we selected and then we're told to wait for a call which would occur within an hour. No call ever came. We were also told that if we changed our minds they would simply put it on the truck and delivery the day after Christmas. After no call we went to a store to purchase back up items. With those items in hand, we called UPS the day after Christmas to ask for delivery only to be told that the information we had been given was wrong and that we could not have picked it up on Christmas Eve and that we now had to go to the will call or they would return the item to its sender.

Somewhere between it being scanned on the UPS truck and when UPS said the driver scanned the item as &#34;delivered&#34;, it disappeared! Just saying, there's a lot of room for funny business here.  Are people inside UPS scanning items as &#34;delivered&#34; and pocketing them? In this case the &#34;recipient&#34; was waiting for delivery. Never saw UPS Truck or Driver, but all UPS will say is that the driver had to scan the item off the truck once delivered. No signature required? The Amazon ordering process does not offer the opportunity to request it be signed for.  According to UPS, only the &#34;shipper&#34; has the option to request a confirmation sig upon delivery and Amazon does not do that.  UPS says they are aware of their trucks being targeted and followed. A delivery is left on a porch and before the truck is gone, someone pilfers the package. The fact that they even told me that and don't mandate a recipient signature tells me that they don't have any concern for the customer. They stand by their driver, driver says it was left on a porch, then it was left on a porch. I was told that if I think it was stolen to file a police report. It took 3 calls to Amazon customer service but I found out that the &#34;delivered&#34; card had been redeemed by someone named &#34;Barbara&#34; who made a purchase thru her Amazon account.

The matter is now in the hands of Amazon fraud dept.  YOU MUST READ THE GIFT CARD DISCLAIMER THAT AMAZON HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR GIFT CARDS LOST or STOLEN AFTER DELIVERY IS CONFIRMED.

I was wrong.<br /><br />I ordered this gift card as a Christmas present for my sister.  I purchased it on Amazon.com and had it shipped directly to her.  Next day shipping was perfect given that I waited until the last minute to do Christmas shopping, but that's where the good part of this card ended.  When my sister tried to enter the claim code on the card, she got an error message saying there was something wrong with the claim code.  She emailed customer service and the response she got was that she needed to have the sender (me) contact the store I bought the card from to have it activated.  Let me remind you that I purchased this card on Amazon.com.<br /><br />So I got in touch with customer service via the online chat option and was told that my issue would have to be elevated to the gift card team and that the card could be activated in 24 to 48 hours.  I told the customer service rep that this was not an acceptable option.  Then the customer service rep said he'd see what he could do... and came back with the response that I need to go to the store I bought the card from and have make sure the store activates it.  Let me remind you yet again that I bought this card from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Then I gave the customer service rep the card's claim code and the Amazon.com order number.  The next response I got was that the gift card's claim code did not match up with what was listed for the order number.  Ugh.  At this point the customer service rep suggested handing this off to the gift card team, which I agreed to.  A few hours later I got an email saying that my credit card would be refunded for this purchase.  I never asked for a refund... just wanted to get the gift card working, but in a round about way it did solve my problem because I then went ahead and bought an email gift certificate and that worked perfectly.<br /><br />After this experience with the card not working and the repeated suggestion from customer service to go to the store I purchased the card from and have them activate it, when I did in fact buy it on Amazon.com, I would definitely steer away from the physical gift card and go for the email version instead.",15702.0

Card Design),Gift Card,1,7,13,N,N,Annoyed with my denomination not being available.,"Unaccustomed to giving gift cards, I happened to spot this advertised.  Though I did not like all the negative reviews about the packaging, I figured it was an in house gift so decided to continue pursuit.  Wanting to order a $100 version, I only saw versions to click on for $50 and $150.  Upon clicking on the $50, planning to order two, I saw that you could select other denominations.  As customary with my purchasing habits, I like to think things over a bit, so decided to have my breakfast and return.  After deciding to go ahead with the order, I went back to the gift card page, and selected this particular boxed display, and the denominations began at $150.  I made other attempts for about 10 minutes, all failing to provide the $100 option, and found the $50 links still led to the $150 minimum.  Next I tried to find how I could call Amazon and speak to a live person or a live chat, and though they do not make the process easy to find or execute, I did find I could provide them with my phone number and they would call me back.  That happened pretty quickly, but the voice connection was poor, and the operator that called was not exactly a genius.  It took forever for her to determine exactly what I was getting at, and eventually it took me about 5 minutes to provide her with the item's ID number and confirm its' accuracy through repeated dialog.  Finally it turned out she could not find a way for me to purchase a $100 denomination, and proceeded to suggest how I could purchase other denominations at $150 and above or I could purchase one of the many other options they have.  She did agree and comment on how nice the Santa display was, but insisted on suggesting other alternatives.  I declined other suggestions, and convinced her I had other local options that I could pick up with a short, local drive.<br /><br />It still puzzles me how they could not provide that denomination at 10 am  but not 11 am, but still provide other denominations.  The free one day shippingis for today only, so I will check back later and see if they have fixed the problem or at least note a problem with lower denominations.  Annoyed!!!",15692.0

Oh, and what was supposed to be a surprise, ended up not being one at all; because after about three weeks of wondering if my family members received these items, I finally started asking.  So not only did I ruin the surprise, but also found out that after 3 weeks of placing the order, no one had received anything.  On the 22nd of January I received an email saying my order had just shipped, with no apology.    Amazon should program their system to send an apology email, if an order takes way too long to ship.  And, I really think they need to stop advertising 1 day shipping, if they can't get the job done in 1 day.",15382.0

I live in UK. When I redeemed the card the credit was put on an amazon.com account, not my UK account. Then when I tried to purchase Kindle books on the .com account I was prevented from doing so and kept getting referred back to amazon.co.uk (Kindle) even though the credit was in the .com account. I then set up a live talk with Amazon in the UK who eventially referred me to Amazon.com who referred me to their Kindle operation who after some time said they had it sorted with AmazonUK and I was given a UK number to ring to follow up. When I rang the UK number they knew nothing of this and told me I would have to speak with amazon.com as there was nothing they could do about a .com gift card . At this point I asked to speak with a Supervisor who restated what had been said already. When I asked her what solution she could offer she suggested I give my daughter in NY my Userid and Password so that she could order something else and pay me the original value of the gift card which was $25 or I could order something (non Kindle) from the .com website and have it sent back to UK. I could not see how Amazon were contributing anything to solving my problem with such a suggestion.  I found this whole episode extremely frustrating and it felt as if I was dealing with two different companies. Why could my Amazon uk account not process the Gift Card and credit my account with the appropriate amount in GBP rather than crediting to a .com account which I never wanted and never set up?  My advice is forget gift cards and certainly do not try to operate across any Amazon country/currency boundaries.",15367.0

I contacted customer service who told me a Visa gift card is not the best way to purchase an Amazon gift card and they would refund the money to the Visa gift card. I then put in another order using my Amazon.com credit card. A card I have used thousands of times before and never had a problem. This time, I received the same message I got when using the Visa gift card. I contacted Customer Service again. The first person I spoke to told me I had a \\""Block\\"" on the account. She could not tell me why that was there, and she informed me she could remove it immediately. This claim brought me some concern so I asked to speak with her manager to find out the reason  a \\""Block\\"" had been placed. The manager claimed there was no \\""Block\\"" on the card and the sale should have gone through fine. So, I again went back and checked on the sale. Again there was a message that it could not be paid using the payment option I had selected. I called back again and told them to cancel the sale. This is extremely disappointing to me, as I have felt for quite some time that Amazon was one of the last customer service oriented sellers around. I guess they too have been pushed to the \\""Make money, screw the customer\\"" attitude this country has been forced into with our economic situation. A trusted company has gone down the drains. I hope to see you come back to your original ideals some day Amazon.",14249.0

She didn't keep track, she figured it would cut her off when she reached her iTune's card limit. She's a kid, what does she know?  Well, her iTunes card had run out (which she did not realize) and downloads automatically began being charged on our credit card!     You can imagine my shock when we got our credit card bill.

First of all, just to use the card you have to download and install iTunes and open an account which will be an annoying hassle for anyone who doesn't already have that program, furthermore, it may force you to update your iTunes as well. Also, if each song is $.99 then that means that anyone who doesn't plan on using iTunes again is losing $0.15. Also, you're technically not allowed to resell, return, or exchange the card based on the terms and conditions of it. Basically, this is a sucky gift unless you know the person will like it. If you don't know what to get someone, a Borders gift card is convenient since it's basically the same thing as an amazon.com gift card.
