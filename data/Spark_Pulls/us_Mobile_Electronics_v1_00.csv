In most cases, we get what we expect.  I was skeptical in purchasing these and saw mixed reviews, but these guys claim to be &#34;Apple MFI Certified&#34; and are &#34;genuine&#34;.  Well...BUYER BEWARE!<br /><br />I purchases these in early July, one for each vehicle so we can keep our phones charged.  I bought them when I did because we were going to take a family trip and I wanted to have something in the car to keep devices charged on the go.  I received these two days before we left, but really didn't get to use them until the trip.  Then, just two days in to the trip, the pins on both sides turned black and the cable STOPPED working.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but other cables I've used in the same way (especially the one that came with my iPhone 5c) have worked WITHOUT ISSUE.  Needless to say, just two days in to our trip and we are down a cable, I was more than a bit peeved.<br /><br />If you purchase these from this seller, it is at your own risk and will be a complete gamble.  I highly recommend to keep looking and steer clear of these guys.  The worst part now, is that I have passed the one month window to return these because once back from my trip, I've had to deal with some work emergencies.  So I've basically just wasted my hard earned money on garbage, with no more option for refund.",16677.0

DON'T BUY,"This has the potential to be a great inexpensive dashcam, but two flaws are ruining it for me:<br />1. Despite what the product pictures show, the camera has a BRIGHT silver lens barrel, not the more subtle black one show in the pics. This would be a minor cosmetic issue, except for the fact that the silver barrel makes this SUPER OBVIOUS if you leave it mounted to your windshield when your car is parked. It's like the damn thing was designed to be enticing to thieves. I contacted Amazon about this and they sent me a second one, which (despite the pics on the site and the product box) also sports the bright silver color. Annoying, but fixable with a Sharpie and some time.<br />2. The dashcam broke within a couple weeks of installing it. It works for about 3 minutes before powering off completely, and refuses to power up again until the power cord is completely disconnected and re-inserted (hardly safe while driving). I've heard good things from trusted sources about this camera so I'm hoping this is just a fluke and hopefully the soon-to-be-received replacement will be awesome, but this early and sudden failure (coupled with the issue noted above) doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.<br /><br />**UPDATE**  Wanted to provide an update. About ~15 months after purchasing the original and then getting the replacement because the 1st one was DOA, the second camera is broken. It powers on and I can &#34;use&#34; it as you'd expect, but it no longer records reliably to memory cards (I've tried with different known-good cards formatted in-camera). Super frustrating to find out that it stopped recording files to the card months ago, despite all the icons on the LCD display indicating everything is working fine. Naturally it is just outside the manufacturers warranty now, so I've got an $89 paperweight. I strongly encourage you to skip this camera and buy something else - this one is junk. :-(",16664.0

The only instructions it came with, was a &#34;quick start&#34; guide, which turned out to be totally useless, and the hand drawn pictures of the player's click wheel do NOT match the actual wheel on the player or its functions, and the wheel itself was hit/miss as to what it would do when clicked.<br /><br />Anyway, I turned on my computer and connected the player to charge it.  My PC promptly flashed a message saying new hardware had been detected, and telling me it needed to be formatted.  Not good.  If you format something, it wipes out what's on there. Nope, don't want to format.  Saying no to formatting kept me from being unable to &#34;see&#34; the player on my PC.  I try unplugging/replugging the player. Same thing.<br /><br />Next, I tried looking through the device itself.  It came preloaded with 2 songs, a video, and several games.  I plugged the player into some external speakers, and was able after several attempts at manuvering the horrible click wheel, to play both songs and the video. Sound and video quality were OK, given the size of the screen. I couldn't manage the click wheel or viewing on the tiny screen, to successfully play any of the games.  The only thing I was able to make work with any consistency, was the radio.<br /><br />I never found anything on the device itself that needed to be addressed before I should have been able to load my own content via my PC. By all logic,  it shouldn't have been much different than loading music/videos onto a flash drive. After an hour of frustration, I disconnected the player and waited for my husband to get home from work.  He couldn't get the player to work either - and he has a degree in computer science!  He confirmed that formatting wipes out everything. He couldn't get the click wheel to work correctly.  He pointed out that the video formats - AMV and MTV - are obscure.  And, he wholeheartedly agrees that this player is JUNK.<br /><br />While I in no way expected this device to be anywhere near the quality of my iPod, to say that I am severely disappointed with its quality and functionality, is an understatement. It's totally useless to me. I will be contacting Amazon/the seller for a FULL refund.ality were OK, given the size of the screen.

I loved the concept of playing your cassette tapes and recording them directly to digital memory media that you have plugged into the cassette player. It is specified to convert the tape's contents to MP3 format. In addition the unit has a built in radio that you can play and record and it also has the ability to record live using a built in microphone. The unit can also play the digitally recorded media back so you can listen to it.<br /><br />I have over 100 audio books that I have purchased over the years on cassette tape and I was excited to convert them to MP3 to add them into iTunes and be able to play them on my Apple devices. I also wanted to burn CD's of the books because the tapes are getting old and they were a large investment in money. I was afraid that they would deteriorate or be accidentally ruined with a magnetic field.<br /><br />What's in the box?<br />* A brief instruction manual<br />* The cassette player<br />* An AC wall USB power supply to power the unit<br />* A USB power cable<br />* A set of earphones<br /><br />The unit is designed to operate on two AA batteries or to use the supplied power supply. In my testing I used eneloop rechargeable batteries and alkaline batteries. I began recording a book with 11 tapes and each side was recorded on making a total 22 tapes about 45 to 50 minutes each in approximate time length. Unfortunately there are multiple issues with the product that make it difficult to use.<br /><br />Problems:<br /><br />1. Using the USB AC power supply made the cassette deck produced a very low volume but high pitched squeal. I recorded the first book and while doing this I could hear the tape clearly playing. When it was done I played the digitally recorded version and all that was recorded was the high pitched squeal. I thought that perhaps the USB power supply was bad so I tried several others that I knew worked and I got the same result. This is obviously a serious flaw with the unit.<br />2. I then recorded a tape using batteries and I found that the batteries only lasted long enough to record 4 to 6 sides of the tapes and then they died. Unfortunately there is no indication on the unit of the batteries' remaining charge so the recorded volume faded or the unit stopped recording without any warning. The unit eats batteries very quickly.<br />3. The play, rewind and fast forward cassette buttons don't always work. At times I had to press the play button 10 times to get the unit to start playing. Unfortunately there is no way to tell if the play button or the reverse or FF button are working as the LCD display has no indication of those functions or battery capacity or whether the unit is playing or paused. If no sound comes out of the built in speaker you have to hold the unit to your ear to see if the motor is turning. I can only attribute the poor functionality of the control buttons to poor quality of switches.<br />4. I recorded the 11 tapes and all 22 sides and it took about 24 to 30 hours. A lot of the time was wasted due to failures of the cassette unit to record properly and dying batteries. I used a Micro USB 32 GIG memory chip and stored the MP3 conversions on it automatically. I could have also used a Thumb drive memory stick as the unit accepts both. I then plugged the Micro SD card into my computer and transferred the recorded files to a computer folder. I was able to play the book using iTunes and the Windows Media player software. I then tried to copy the recorded files to my Apple iPhone and it would not copy the files as it stated file format was incompatible with Apple devices. That was odd since they stated they were MP3 format. I then tried to burn a music CD ROM to play the book in my car and my Windows computer would not burn an MP3 compatible music CD ROM because the file format was a strange one. I dug into the matter and found that the recorded files were MP3 but used MPEG-1 layer 2 technology which is not the one used by most devices. The Apple products for example use MPEG-1 layer 3 technology. I found a technique to convert the files to MP3 MPEG-1 layer 3 and I am able to now play them on my Apple products and to burn MP3 music discs properly. This is a problem and I think some people would be able to resolve this issue and get the media to play on their smart phones. Please note that I did not try to play the files on an Android operating system but I am positive that the final result that I achieved would work.<br /><br />The supplier was helpful but unfortunately this product is what it is. In its present format I cannot endorse the use of this product without design changes and updates. I rated this product at 1 star. This is unfortunate as it is a great concept. I think a lot of people would want something like this to convert their old cassette music and book tapes to MP3 but it would have to be in a version that they could use with their other smart media devices.

Though, it’s so bad, that I felt an injustice by ignoring it. This is what you’d buy from Chinatown as a Christmas gag gift. If it isn’t a gag gift, you’ll either use it once before it breaks, or break it yourself. Details inside, including a full TLDR.<br /><br />▶ Package Contents<br />• Tom America MP3 Player<br />• 8gb Micro SD Card<br />• Mini USB Cable<br />• 3.5mm Stereo Earphones<br />• User manual<br /><br />▶ Specifications<br />Usually I’d state specifications here, but this MP3 player has absolutely no documentation for such information.<br /><br />▶ Hardware<br />The hardware of the Tom America MP3 Player is very confusing. It tries very hard to be an iPod Nano clone, but fails miserably.<br /><br />It measures at 3.75” x 1.6” x 0.25” with a 2” LCD screen. As the iPod Nano, at the bottom features a “mouse wheel”, which really is four buttons: Menu, Volume, Next Track, and Previous Track. At the center of the mouse wheel is an ON/OFF/Back/(Other?) button, but I’ve noticed that the switch at the top controls ON/OFF as well.<br /><br />The top features the micro SD slot for inserting memory cards. This should be expandable up to 128GB, but I wouldn’t understand using a $100+ micro SD card on a cheap MP3 player.<br /><br />The bottom features a 3.5mm audio port, for your standard headphones, a microphone, and a mini USB cable port. It’s very interesting to be using a mini USB port, since it’s a deprecated charging interface that hasn’t been used for many small electronics in almost 8 years. It should have featured a micro USB port, as it’s common in cell phones, tablets, speakers, and several other small electronics.<br /><br />A micro SD card reader is unnecessary, as you’re able to connect the MP3 player to your computer and transfer files.<br /><br />▶ Software<br />What seems as a trivial pursuit in hardware is even worse in software.<br /><br />Picture this. You turn on the media player and are welcomed by a wonderful multi-color display. The display is very much pixelated, but pictures and video are easily recognizable. It’s nothing to complain about at its price point.<br /><br />There are several menus to choose from: Music, Record, Play (Recordings), Movie, Radio, Picture, Settings, Text (eBooks), and Games (yes, that isn’t a misprint).<br /><br />Lots a choices! Let’s choose one: Music. That’s when you realize how unintuitive the controls are. While in main menu selection, you’re required to press the “Menu Button”, because the center button doesn’t select, instead it powers your MP3 player off.<br /><br />The controls in your desired menu will vary. Sometimes they’ll be as described, but many times they aren’t. It became very frustrating to have the Center button select in one menu, and then turn off my MP3 player in another. There simply aren’t any uniform controls, let alone intuitive ones.<br /><br />▶ Testing<br />I’ve been trying very hard to objectively use this MP3 player for the past few days. Unfortunately, it has become very difficult to use an MP3 Player with lackluster buttons. I’ve literally had to hard press the buttons in order for them to work. I’ve never had to apply such force to an MP3 player before.<br /><br />This made playing games almost impossible. It’s difficult to play Tetris or Snake when the feedback of the buttons are over a second long.<br /><br />Music quality of songs were clear and crisp. Though, how the media player handles music is awful. Despite including a micro SD card that can hold almost 2000+ songs, it’ll only play a handful of them. I’d say about 30-40. The music isn’t shuffled either. There is no way to shuffle music.<br /><br />Recording audio was very nice, as the microphone is sensitive but not too sensitive. I didn’t hear any static on playback.<br /><br />▶ Final Thoughts<br />At times it pains me toreview items that are so bad that I wonder why I accepted the review unit in the first place. Button feedback is bad, interface is unintuitive, and the MP3 player doesn’t play more than a handful of songs. The way I see it, you paid $24 for a 8GB Micro SD card, a Mini USB Cable, and 3.5mm Ear phones. The MP3 player is just the item that cons you into buying it.<br /><br />1 Star (I’d rate -100 Stars if I could)<br />NOT RECOMMENDED (NEVER EVER EVER EVER BUY THIS)<br /><br />▶ TLDR;<br />Pros:<br />+ Cheap price point.<br />+ A vivid colorful display.<br />+ A wide menu variety.<br />+ Includes 8GB Micro SD Card, Generic Earphones, and a mini USB Cable<br />+ Able to transfer files without the need of an SD Card reader<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Uses a deprecated charging interface.

UPDATED REVIEW,"[[VIDEOID:88da032d4b4dbe26b39f837ca6d71d4a]] Last year I lost one of my two car key fobs and have not been able to find it yet. Since then, there have been several incidences that I was almost losing the only remaining fob. Finally, I realized that I need a device like this which could help me relocate and save me time.  I bought this set for that reason.<br />I have had it for a few days and have already put one of the receivers on my main keychain. Although there has been no occasion that I really needed to use this set for locating my key yet, I made a few tests to see if it is working or not.<br />The set consists of 4X receivers, 4X button batteries CR2032, 4 keychain attachment rings ( tiny but works okay), 4 double sided stickers (in case you want to stick it on an item rather than adding it to your keychain) and a remote control with its stand. The remote control works with 2 AAA batteries which you need to supply yourself.<br /><br />There is an instruction manual but the operation is pretty easy anyways. There are 4 buttons on the front which are color coded with matching colors on the fobs (You may use small stickers to remind you what is what but to me it is not necessary.) When you press the button for a few seconds the corresponding receiver starts beeping. I tested the reception by hiding the stuff under need some pillows and going one floor below. It still triggered okay. The sound is okay in the room that the receiver is in and diminishes as you go away. But if the surrounding is silent you may still hear it when there are two floors plus various walls and rooms between .

The idea was good, however it is now worthless except that the video still displays, although it is no longer recording. If you read the previous comments, you will also notice that several questions regarding the functions were never fully explained and others just didn't make any sense. It appears that I cannot return this item as it is now beyond the return period. My suggestion is for anyone considering buying this unit, don't as it was not made well and therefore will not last. ++++++++++++++++++++ Update 04-09-15 I received additional information from E-Prance concerning the original and new questions. I have designated these responses with +++. ++++++++++++++++++++ Update 04-07-15 I have received a response from E-Prance concerning the above questions. They are concerned about the problems, however I think the major problem is that there is a language barrier that causes some of the issues and some of the issues center around incomplete or confusing information both in the manual that is provided, the actual operation of the camera, and the viewing of the files on your computer. They have a good product, however the actual operation of it presents some challenges. They have replied to me via email and wanted me to respond only to their email, but it would be mutually beneficial to them and the consumer to know the answers to the above questions and perhaps more questions. To make it easier to read, I will place the first and second response below the original question and signify it with a + sign for the 03/31/15 response and a ++ sign for the 04/07/15 response. My replies will be below each response. They have a good product and even though I am having these issues, I still think it is worth considering or I would not take the time to address these issues.  I did not address the km/mile issue, but it would be better if we could select either miles or kilometers. Perhaps they could provide an update to allow this.   +++&#34;About the km/mile issue, sorry it is the design defective, we will reflect it to the factory to suggest them improve it in future.&#34;   My reply: This is a major problem and it should be fixed.  The manual is not complete, but it should be and it is sometimes difficult to understand.  ********* Original Review/questions **************  Hello, I have not been able to get this to work properly. Here are some questions: 1. I have the GPS model, therefore when I want to download or view the recorded files, should the USB data cable be plugged into the camera or into the GPS module attached to it?   +&#34;You should connect the camera with USB data cable when you want to download or view the recorded files.&#34;   ++&#34; I think this answer is very clear, you should connect to camera not the gps module. The USB jack on the gps module is only used to apply charge. so why you said it did not address the issue? Could you please kindly explain to us or we misunderstood your meaning.&#34;   My reply:The answer that I needed was included in the above answer. I did find out that I am unable to get to the menu where you are able to change the setting unless I plugged the USB cable into the GPS module instead of the camera body.  2. Do I need to view the files only using the Media Player?   +&#34;You can view the files with the Media Player,but  it does not show the GPS signal when you using the Media Player.   My reply: The reason for the question was due to confusion as to how to view the files that include the GPS map. If the Media Player, the included software, will not allow me to view it, then what program do I need to view the files that would include the GPS map?   ++&#34;About the 2.3.4 questions you said all about the media player and software, the software was in theCD, when you install the cd, it has one player files and other files may need to be install, but you needn't install any software, just open the player file then you can open the media player directly, then choose the DICM files you can open the videos you want.&#34;   My reply: I installed the software that was included which apparently is not needed. The problem was that there are no instructions concerning this and if you do decide to install it, you are presented with several options that make it very confusing which resulted in my original question. Bottom line is don't install the software.   +++&#34;About how to use the media player, you can check the third pdf files you can know how to use it.&#34;   My reply: This answer just doesn't make sense. If you mean a pdf reader, then how would that work with a GPS map?  3. If using the Media Player, how do I select the files on the camera to be viewed?   +&#34;Please try to connect the camera to a computer with the USB cable and download the files for view.&#34;   My reply: This did not answer the question. I did not need to know how to connect the USB. What I need to know was the procedure for selecting the files to be viewed? The software is not intuitive and just plain goofy, as an example, even though I would highlight a file, it would discard it.   ++see 2 4. When installing the software included with this purchase, what files do I need to select for this to work properly?   +&#34;We suggest you select the Player in this software ,and use this Player to view your files.&#34;   My reply: There are several options to select when installing your software, and many of them have a cryptic title which make it impossible to know if it is something that I need to install, so for normal purposes can you provide a list of the files that need to be uploaded so that I might be able to retrieve, save and review the files that would include the GPS map. When you say Player, do you mean the Media Player?   ++see 2   +++&#34;About the software in the CD,it is a decoded file, if you can't open the media player, you can us the driver to decode to open successfully.&#34;   My reply: I am not sure what you mean when you say that it is a decoded file. I am able to access all of the files. The problem is that there are no directions or explanations given concerning the files. What is needed are installation instructions that describe the options available. Currently, it is just a massive list of files with no instructions or descriptions.  5. What does the Time Lapse option do? Does it affect any other function?   +&#34;Time Lapse,it also means &#34;Time-lapse photography&#34;,&#34;By setting a certain time interval shooting, the same scene or the same object at a certain frequency automatic shooting long continuous shooting frame by frame to form a combination of thousands of photos from the continuous screen, and automatically processing animation video which will require some time to concentrate for a few minutes to complete the process of image presented. Eliminating the inconvenience of long photography&#34;   ++&#34;About the Time Lapse your means you can speed up the slow motion to save more time and memory space, it is a technique photographs a naturally slow process, such as plant growth, on movie film at intervals, so that continuous projection of the frames gives an accelerated view of the process.&#34;   My reply: This would only be useful in the camera mode and doesn't make sense to use it since the video is overwritten.   +++&#34;About the Time Lapse, maybe you are right, it is just for a auxiliary function for the dvr.&#34;  6. What does the Stamp function do? Does this affect the file when it is downloaded for viewing?   +&#34;Stamp function,it help you mark the date ,you GPS model and your license plate number on the recording pictures.&#34;   My reply: Perhaps I didn't phrase the question correctly. I didn't need to know what the options were, as that is clear, but what I needed to know was when you select one of the options, lets say GPS, does that mean it imprints the GPS coordinates onto the image and would therefore show up on the file when it was viewed? If I do not select GPS, will the GPS map still be displayed upon viewing? If I select some other stamp, say the license number, will it likewise be displayed in the viewed files, yet I will still be able to view the GPS map?   ++&#34;About the stamp function, if you choose GPS it will shows the speed on the video, if you choose the date, license, it will show the date license on the video.&#34;   My reply: I had selected &#34;date/time stamp&#34; and changed it to &#34;GPS stamp&#34; and will see what happens. The videos when played on my computer do not display the GPS map and perhaps selecting this will allow that, but according to the above answer it will display the speed. What is confusing about this issue is that when you bring up the Media player it shows an area for the map, which by the way is centered on Moscow, but the map that coincides with the video file that you want to view does not display. I would like to be able to view the video files with the map as it doesn't make sense to have it otherwise. I will see what happens with the above setting and hopefully the map will be displayed along with the video.   +++&#34;The GPS map can only display on the computer, it can't display on the dvr when you are driving, because the gps function is only gps logger, not gps nagativation.&#34;   My reply: This does not answer the question. I understand that it should only be displayed when played back. You need to provide clear directions on what settings are needed to allow the map to be displayed upon playback and then what is needed to view the files that include the map.  7. What is the EV setting for?   +&#34;EV setting,exposure value,Although in theory all exposure parameters are given in the same shot with the same exposure, but they are not necessarily the same photo shoot. Exposure time (shutter speed) determines the degree of motion blur.&#34;   ++&#34;The EV setting is the exposure value setting the aperture and speed and it is for all modes, i don't know what list you mean, it used the the numbers to indicate the EV.&#34;   My reply: The selections for EV are 0  0.3  0.7  1  1.3  1.7  2  -2 -1.7  -1.3  -1  -0.7  -0.3, so not sure why they do not understand my question. At the present time I have it set to 0.   +++&#34;EV setting you can set the 0, you can adjust it accoring to the brightness you want.&#34;   My reply: Can you tell me under what circumstances would I need to change this setting and what setting would that be?  8. What does the GPS Auto Update Time do?   +&#34;GPS Auto Update Time, the GPS function could make the time matching your local time by automatically.&#34;   My reply: Good answer. Any reason not to have this function on?   ++&#34;About this function GPS Auto Update Time, you need let it on then the time will corect all the time once you install the gps module.&#34;   My reply: Good answer. 9. How do you use the GPS Setup and what is it for?   +&#34;GPS Setup,GPS is able to help users to accurately locate the current position, and calculate the itinerary, GPS navigation systems in accordance with established destinations via map display and voice prompts guide the instrument in two ways to the destination .&#34;   My reply: Is this function only for initially setting up the GPS? If for initializing the GPS, how long do I need to keep it on? Otherwise, does it need to be on for the GPS function to work normally? The GPS does not have voice prompts, so not sure what you mean?   ++ Not addressed.   +++&#34;GPS Setup you need let it on if you want track the logger.&#34;   My reply: What do you mean by &#34;track the logger&#34;? 10. Initially I had the LDWS Detect on, however it was constantly sounding the alarm. I set the LDWS Calibration to Yes, but wasn't sure how to know if or when it had completed the calibration. Is there a procedure for calibrating LDWS so that it actually alarms when it is supposed to?   +&#34;with the LDWS Detect on'it actually alarms when your car off-track.&#34;   My reply: I understand what the function of LDWS is for. Please refer to original questions regarding this. It has a function to calibrate, but in that mode it does not function as a LDWS. I selected the calibration mode for a couple of trips, and thought that it might help with the constant alarming when I turned this function off, however there was no difference. Could you provide a procedure for calibrating and using this function, including the suggested settings?   ++&#34;About the LDWS calibration, when you choose, it will give constant alarming when you take off the track, it you go back to the right track, it will stop alarming.&#34;   My reply: There are two selections concerning LDWS, LDWS Detect and LDWS Calibration. I have it turned off since it is sporadically alarming even when driving in a lane for a long period and not moving out of the lane. Each of these have ON/OFF selections and the calibration did not seem to make a difference.   +++&#34;LDWS calibration, it is just on/off button, you just need turn it on when you driving.&#34;   My reply: This did not answer the question. I understand that you can select on/off and would assume that during calibration that you would be driving. My question is how long are you supposed to calibrate it?  11. There are 7 resolution selections and one of them is 1920X1080/30F (HDR). What difference does the HDR make as compared to 1920/1080/30F?   +&#34;There are 7 resolution selections help you avoid the poor quality pictures in dark or high-lights environment.&#34;   My reply: I know that there are different selections. Please see original question. Do you have a recommended setting for normal conditions? Would you select a different setting for night driving?   ++&#34;About the resolution, we advise you choose the highest 2560*1080 30FPS, 2304*1296 30FPS, it is clearer but need more space to storage, so it depends on your choose.&#34;   My reply: See original question.   +++&#34;HDR is also can balance the light when you take the video.&#34;   My reply: So this is the only option that you should select since the implication is that the other options do not balance the light?  *****************additional questions 04-07-15  12: What is the recommended G_sensor setting? The options are: off  1  through 7.   +++&#34;The recommended G_sensor setting is 4 .&#34;  13: What is WDR? Options: off/on.   +++&#34;WDR can balance the light in the very strong or dim environment.&#34;  14: Does the Video Quality options, which are Normal, Fine, and S.Fine, affect the recorded video and/or the screen view on the camera?   +++&#34;Video Quality options affect the recorded video and the screen view on the camera, the clearness will be different according to the different choice.&#34;  15: When I attach the USB cable to the unit for viewing the files on the computer, the menu buttons only seem to work when it is plugged into the GPS module. When plugged into the camera body it displays &#34;USB connecting&#34; and brings up the screen to select the files, however, if I want to view or change any of the options on the unit I have to plug the USB cable into the GPS module. I would like to know if this is normal?   +++&#34;This problem i have confirmed with our engineer, it is normal.When you connect the camera, view or changed options can't be operated, if you want you need plug into the GPS module.&#34;   My reply: This should be changed if possible.  I will probably change the star rating if these questions could be answered. I sent the same questions to them directly, but did not hear from them. The unit is very good, however the directions included are not complete and difficult to understand due to some poor English. It has worked great so far, but still uncertain about how to set it up, download and viewfiles, etc.",16519.0

Then I got a new router and tried to re-install the extender. This has been an existential experience.

When I managed to get connected to NetGear's support I discovered that after 90 days have elapsed since the purchase, you are not allowed to talk to anyone or chat with a service representative. They said I could email them, so I did. I got an email that said they could not answer my question, but I could purchase a service plan starting at $39.99. I discovered that would cover one incident. If I want, say, a year of unlimited coverage it would set me back over a hundred bucks--which is substantially more than I paid for the unit in the first place. They were disingenuous enough to send me a survey rating my customer service experience.

I thought, perhaps since these was a minority, that I might not have that problem. I was wrong (my mistake).<br /><br />The fact is, this is a poorly designed player. The casing is weak plastic that I suspect would shatter upon its first drop (and we all do drop them on occasion, right?). The controls did not make sense, as you had to hit the up (menu) button to select something but the middle button (which on most models is the select key) was the back-up button. The side-scroll buttons only made things go up and down and the folders were a ridiculous mess. The screen resolution was terrible. I didn't expect much, but my Gameboy Micro from 10 years ago has better screen resolution. Technology has improved, friends, so it shouldn't be this bad even on such a cheap unit.<br /><br />And finally, the battery is a mess. It arrived &#34;fully charged&#34; but drained of 70% of its power just in the 1/2 hour I used it to learn the ridiculous controls. Then, after listening to 30 minutes of music and watching 1 22-minute tv show, it died and never took a charge again. I used multiple outlets (both USB and wall plugs), multiple cables (I had some old cables that were compatible), but nothing worked. It said it was charging, but never accepted the charge. So it remained dead.<br /><br />I bought this just to have something for my kids to listen to in the car, but it couldn't even do that. So I gave up and returned it. I highly recommend that you avoid this product. I suspect that most of the positive reviews were from people who liked it on day one (I didn't hate it on day 1) but by day 3 it was dead and they never bothered to update their review.",16502.0

I'd advise the readers of this review to spend the extra few dollars and buy a genuine Apple lighting cable.  I've attached a picture of the first cable that broke.<br /><br />I typically don't leave reviews but iXCC sent me an email to review their product and I'm procrastinating on writing my essay that is due tomorrow so here we go...  Avoid this charger if possible.  A friend of mind vacuumed up my genuine lightning cable and decided to apologize by replacing it with this one, citing the overall excellent reviews and &#34;#1 best seller&#34; tag.  'No problem', I thought... Until I used the cable for a while.  It worked without a hitch until about a month later when I tried to remove it from my phone...  Part of the cable (the part that 'goes in' to the phone) broke off and stayed inside my phone!  Off to the garage to grab some pliers and pull the piece of the now-broken charger out.<br /><br />I figured this was just a fluke, so I went back to Amazon to get another iXCC brand lightning cable.  I even made sure it was &#34;genuine&#34; by selecting iXCC as the seller (the old one came in the &#34;genuine&#34; packaging as well, so no, it wasn't a fake).  This time, I ordered the two pack as it's cheaper-per-cable and I didn't want to be without a charger again in the event the new one broke.  &#34;I'll just have an extra cable for the car or something&#34;, I thought... Nope!  Not even TWO DAYS after the new cables arrived, one of them suffered the same exact fate as the old one!<br /><br />So, here I am, using my last iXCC lighting cable, just waiting for it to suffer the same fate as the first two.  I don't know what the lighting cable manufacturing process is like, but you'd think that one should be able to stand up to being removed from your phone.  And no, before you assume I abuse my stuff, these cables had been relegated to bedside charging duties...  No getting squashed at the bottom of a backpack, no being dragged across miles of campus, not even being used as something to dangle my phone from.  Literally used to charge my phone before bed and when I wake up.<br /><br />Oh, and that Apple cable that got vacuumed up?  It's still going strong in my pickup, after two and a half years of service and a near-death experience (it does look a bit &#34;weathered&#34;, however).<br /><br />Note:  I haven't contacted iXCC about a warranty replacement because I tossed the first cable and haven't gotten around to filing a complaint about the second, so I can't comment on their customer service.  I just expect the stuff I buy to work when I need it to work.  Not that big of an expectation, is it?backpack, no being dragged across miles of campus, not even being used as something to dangle my phone from.

The device itself is pretty amazing, but the software and the quality of Apple support easily makes this a 1 star item. It should be noted that once your iPod is set up, if you connect it to any other computer and attempt to run iTunes it will erase all of the music on your iPod. Also, if you don't buy your music on iTunes, which I don't as it's much cheaper on other websites, it can make managing the music in iTunes a nightmare. As far as the Apple support, I have been lied to, hung up on, and have ended up talking to people who are very rude almost 100% of the time. And they charge $30 to talk to a technician with no guarantee of actually being able to help you. When the iPod works, it works well but when it doesn't the chances of you being able to resolve the issue without paying a substantial fee is almost nonexistent. Also, the amount of time I have spent over the years tying to get iTunes to work and constantly trying to figure out the new iTunes software (which is released very frequently) adds up to an impressive amount of hours.

I don't have a smart phone and I'm not really into tech gadgets, I simply wanted something to listen to music in while working. Even with what I thought were pretty low requirements for a portable music player I find myself very disappointed with this product and really wish I had not wasted my money on it. Seems to me that this is just a glorified memory stick with playback capabilities and $20 or so should be enough to make a device that at the very least works. Loading the music was straight forward, but that is where any satisfaction ended for me. First this unit has no shuffle mode, how hard would it be to include this simple feature. I loaded my downloaded music and cd's onto the unit hoping I could shuffle randomly through the library, but no such luck. You either have to choose one cd at a time or use the create playlist option. This wouldn't be so bad, but the playlist option is basically useless. Instead of randomly creating a playlist it seems to create the exact same list every time you use it. So once you've listened to the list it becomes boring, and worse it doesn't even include all the songs on the device. Second issue started happening a few days into ownership and at this point I will probably just throw this player away. At first it worked ok for playing music, but in a short time it started having issues. The player will just stop playing for no reason at all and when you try to restart your music it throws up a format error. When I am working I don't have time to constantly fidget with this device, so i generally just ended up turning it off. To sum up, this is a terrible MP3 player and not worth anything at all, even if I had paid $5 I'd still be disappointed. I guess I've learned my lesson and will spend more on a name brabd product. So take my advice, put the $20 you may spend on this unit towardsa quality MP3 or you will be throwing your money away.",16473.0

For example, instead of pressing the down button to scroll  down you press the right button; instead of pressing the middle select button to select you will press the menu button (top button). Those are just a few of the things that make this device nonsensical. When you place folders with mp3 files (MP4s don't seem to work), it plays them in some order I can't figure out and you cannot select which folder plays.

This navigation card set is really basic, the font size is very small, there are no luminous spots on them, and they are only useful for beginners, if that!  Thus, even for the beginners it would be far better for them to spend the money on a good base-plate compass which has luminous markings, different map scales, a magnifying glass, and a good navigation or survival guide book.  The compass you choose will however depend upon price, degree of accuracy required, as well as where you will use it which in which cases you may need to compensate for declination. The author suggests that readers look at compasses  made from companies such as Silva (Sweden) and Suunto (Finland) to name a couple.

FLICKERS.<br />- No matter which song I listened to last, it always defaulted me to a pre-programmed song that it came with the next time it turned on. Seriously, there was no option to go through artists or albums first before I get to play a song, it ALWAYS defaults me to the pre-installed country crap, causing me to pause and tediously flip through lists.<br />- And here's the kicker: the next morning when I went to turn it on and prepare a song to listen to?

At that point, I decided to delete everything and start over.<br /><br />I used the delete function on the device to delete all of the files.  Most were deleted.  At that point, the music folder was corrupt and security on the folder was set to read only rendering the music folder unusable.  The files were corrupt, and I was unable to access the folder, play the music that was there, add any music, etc... etc...<br /><br />So... within 3-4 hours of getting the device, it stopped working.<br /><br />My advise would be not to purchase this mp3 player.",16391.0

Told her the problem and 1 simple question. She then asked for my phone number to have a tech support person call me right back. Being on the cautious side id it anyway. Less then 1 minute later I received a call. Couldn't understand him very clearly. He almost instantly sent me to give him permission to take over my computer and find the problem. I complied. He then moved around the screen and then told me that I had been hacked over 25 thousand times. Well this is a brand new laptop with 3 security systems so I was hesitant to believe him. He then showed me all these addresses. Keep in mind still hasen't got to my 1 question how to fix my extender. After about a half hour he proceeds to show me netgears protection plans and tries to sell me a 300 per year one. Then told me I had to buy the 99 dollar one for the service he just did. WHAT? He never got to hooking up my range finder. At this point I thought it was bogus and I was being hacked. I unhooked EVERYTHING and turned off all computers on my network.

What I received was not branded, so finding manufacturer support for the product goes from very difficult to nearly impossible although the product is pin to pin compatible with the Sainsmart model    2) The screen arrived scratched.  (I decided to evaluate the product anyway to ensure that it met my needs before deciding to return for an exchange, or just outright return.  Read further). It arrived simply wrapped in bubble wrap and taped.  No anti-static bag, etc.    3) After also purchasing the matching shield for this screen, I have now been informed by Sainsmart that the touch screen and SD capabilities cannot be used at the same time as the TFT display because Arduino UNO doesn't have enough pins to support all of it.  In actuality, the video chip on the board is perfectly capable of operating in a lower pin mode if only the board and shield were setup properly to do so.  They are not, making this item totally useless for an Arduino UNO (might as well get just a plain TFT LCD with no touch or SD card in this case).  The markings on the shield that mention 'touch screen' and 'SD card' are deceiving.    I will be returning both this touch screen and the shield    Edit:  As it turns out, after investigating this with an expert, the issue is that the screen is unnecessarily hard-wired to only allow 16-bit parallel communication for the TFT screen.  The chips themselves are capable of 8 bit or SPI but these modes are not accessible based on the product's form factor and wiring.  It may be possible to switch this to 8 bit parallel by desoldering a resistor from the ribbon cable and then resoldering it in the vacant spot next to it.  Warning: this requires a very high level of soldering skill and it may be very easy to inadvertently burn through the ribbon while attempting to do so.  The pins to enable SPI for the TFT communication are simply inaccessible due to the permanent nature of how the LCD is glued together.",16359.0

My radio stopped receiving & transmiting properly. This was cured by using another antenna. If this happens to your set remove the outer rubber sleeve of the antenna by wedging the guts out from the sma end. You will find a circuit board a few inches long. Check for broken solder joints at both ends of the board! Very poor design. Do yourselves a favour & avoid this rubbish. Go for the wouxun kguvd1p or a second hand Japanese set. Thought I'd update this review. Had the radio for over a year now & it's still junk. Connect a mobile external antenna & the receiver will completely overload. The battery is draining at an alarming rate even when the set is switched off making it useless as an emergency radio unless you remove the battery pack , yet another bad design aspect of an already dreadful radio.

Little did I know that the camera I bought from Tech-e (prime eligible) was not the same unit. I elected to go with them as the vendor because BAIKLOV (the main seller of this model) has a 2-3 week lead time before shipping and I wanted the cam sooner than that.  Well What I got from Tech-e was a very cheap knock off of the 0801.  First think I noted was it did not have the printed 1080P markings or the front facing speaker as shown. After that I had to fight the camera to get it to accept my SD card in the slot. Once that was done I fought the GPS module to keep it secured to the camera. There isn't any way to do this, and the fit of the camera to the GPS mount is very loose and does not make a good connection.  After I got that sorted out I went to try and decipher the users manual. With some time spent making sens of the poorly translated instructions I attempted to go in and set the unit up and get it ready for use.  Well to my surprise there is no way to change the settings at all.<br /><br />So I decided to check out the quality of the video this thing was capturing in one last ditch effort to justify my purchase. Well the actual camera unit is of such poor quality and has a cheap lens that produces a very bad fish bowl effect. Playback on the unit was not smooth at all. Instead it's displays 1 frame every 2 seconds. During all this I had it plugged into my power port in my car and I noticed that this camera got very hot.<br /><br />So I am returning it and going to purchase the one sold by BAIKLOV in hopes that it is not a cheap knock off.  So shoppers please be aware that if you want the actual dash camera that's depicted here DO NOT buy it from Tech-e.",16233.0

No such luck. I installed the software on an XP Virtual machine on my WIndows 7 Computer. The install went fine and the adaptor was recognized and the light was green on the cable. Upon plugging it in and running the software though, the light turned red and the software offered very few options for customization. I tried reinstalling everything and changing some settings in XP. Same result. Tried it with the truck running and with it off with the key on. Same result. As the update program doesn't work for the adaptor (can't reach the website) I figured that maybe since the Techstream software provided was version 9.10.037 that the adaptor wasn't up to it without updating it so I tracked down version 8.00.034. and installed it along with the drivers. Same result. Light turns red and offers few customization options.

I paid $46.00 shipped from China.<br /><br />I had the cam for about a week, and being new to how these devices operate, noticed file gaps within my video files (using a Transcend 16GB Class 10 SDHC).  What I mean is that I know of two instances on two separate occasions that should have been recorded, but to my dismay were missing from the files.  I had the video recordings before and after these occurrences, so I realized that this cam would intermittently stop recording for up to 10 seconds or more while driving.  I only discovered this non-recording when I was able to pay more attention to what the cam was doing while in operation.  I noticed that the red dot recording indicator would disappear from the screen, then the screen would go to a blank, black screen, and then finally come back on.  It would take an additional 5 or more seconds for the red dot recording indicator to illuminate again.  I also had a battery issue where the cam would not turn on even after holding down the power button.  I had to remove the battery and reinstall, and as luck would have it the cam would turn on.  Needless to say, you may receive a defective piece of junk.<br /><br />I had to open a case with ebay due to the defective cam.  The seller played games and refused to send me a prepaid postage label or a partial refund in lieu of returning due to the cost.  I would have to pay, according to the USPS website, $41.46, which is the online price or $46.30 postal store price to send a 2lb package Priority Mail International back to China.  Ebay will not refund unless you ship the item back, so this purchase for me was a 70% loss.  I still have a working, unreliable, cam, but for how long?.  Did not mean to bore you with ebay info, but keep this in mind when you are shopping around.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this cam may not be reliable, so you cannot depend on it.  Can you take that chance to not have an incident captured with all of brain dead drivers on the road today???  Buyer Beware if you buy from China  - my advice would be to AVOID CHINA!!!<br /><br />PS.  You can find a similar DVR on ebay for less than $20 - you may as well go for that one.

The woofers are cheap injection-cone woofers with stamped frames, ferrite magnets, and no ventilation on either side of the voice coil.  They look like something you would find on MCM electronics for $6 a pair.

After many hours of listening though, I think that the tweeters are fine; the problem is the woofers.  I don't have measuring equipment at this time, but it is obvious that these suffer from horrible non-linear distortion across the frequency range, with a horrible cone break up right smack in the vocal and snare drum range that makes Tool's &#34;1000 Days&#34; album completely unlistenable.

They fail on every level. Undaunted a couple years back I realized the concept was valid so began collecting parts on the cheap to do it right and though it took me about 20 hours of labor and $60 for parts (that would retail over $200) I did install a 10watt solar panel on the roof of my Honda Passport SUV, with an EBM papst (read: German, industrial quality) cross flow 14&#34;w blower just below the upper rear hatch frame and it works superbly. I leave the dash vent control on fresh air and it pulls about 50 CFM (cubic feet per minute) of fresh air in at the dash, through the cabin and out the upper rear hatch. No water or varmints can get in, and I can switch the solar panel output to charge the vehicle's battery in winter.<br />Though I found my blower and panel at a thrift store it's not likely you will so you can find both of these or similar items right here on Amazon, Amazon has a great selection of solar panels at prices you won't likely beat anywhere new. . This is not a project for those with a new car or lacking tools or skills- I had to cut slots in inner and outer sheet metal, flatten a corrugated portion, paint, make a screen in the plastic trim bezel, make a wood frame and bond it to the metal and much more- but I was dead serious about making the sun work for me instead of baking me and if you want to do it post up a reply and I'll link you to pics and will guide you.<br />You could also do it much simpler and not so much a permanent factory quality modification, depends on the vehicle.<br />Or you can waste your money on junk like this product I'm reviewing which is an insult since it appears neither the manufacturer nor distributor of these ever actually tested it on a car.

Despite the problems with the camera, E-Prance was friendly and helpful. They not only refunded my purchase price but the $16.50 I paid to return the camera to China. I would definitely buy from E-Prance again.<br /><br />04-12-14 I am going to reclassify this camera as junk. My last cam was cheap, $29 on Woot. I put a memory card in it, went through the menus and it never gave me a single problem. This is the opposite. Sometimes it just stops recording. Sometimes it says there is an error in the last recording. Sometimes it turns on to a solid blue light and is dead. After some period of time it will come back to life. The only way to have your date correct is to turn off the GPS. I switched to the recommended Samsung class 6 memory from the class 10 Sandisk. No change. Sometimes I have to turn it on and off 5 times to finally get the menu to come up. I am going back to my cheap camera that works all the time, every time.<br /><br />Original Review: This is my 2nd dash cam. My 1st was not 1080p and did not have GPS or good low light recording. The picture quality is great on this one, day or night. It is tiny and unobtrusive on the windshield. The screen is so small that you can leave it on and it is not distracting for night driving. Since it is so small, I don't feel the need to remove it from the car when I park because a thief is unlikely to notice it. Some reviews complained about the GPS only showing KPH but I guess they fixed it because I had a choice. If a small camera is high on your criteria, then I wholeheartedly recommend this one.<br /><br />Cons: I have set the clock three times and it keeps reverting to some unknown time zone that I don't happen to be in. Since GPS is based on knowing the exact time, that is confusing. Also, the menu will only pull up while the camera is connected to the base, which happens to be glued to the windshield. Changing menu items is awkward because itis a tiny screen and high up on the windshield and I am not young. The camera only has up and down motion, so if something happens off to the side of your car, you cannot swing it left or right as I have done with my old cam on a couple of occasions when I drove past something interesting. The software for your computer to play back videos is stored right in the camera and, at best, is adequate. The GPS map plays in satellite mode. You can set it to map, but it goes back to satellite on the next segment. There are no other settings in the playback software that you can set. You cannot set it to full screen. It should let you go full screen on the video or GPS. Playback speed seems to be in KPH even if the camera is set to MPH. It would also be nice if you could change the camera settings from the computer, you cannot. I would also like to see ePrance provide a method for downloading firmware updates from their web site.<br /><br />In short, I am not unhappy with the camera and I am not thrilled with the camera. I certainly feel like it was a good value for the dollar, but I would not buy it again.<br /><br />Edit: Since I posted that review I have discovered the FREE Registrator Viewer program for playing back your videos on the PC. It is amazing and everyone who buys this cam should track it down.",16164.0

There is no apparent support phone number, just a submission form on their website to which they don't appear to respond to.  As of now, I have an expensive brick.<br /><br />Their website loads painfully slow and it takes several hours to download 50mb firmware updates from the site.  It's almost like they have their web server connected to a dial-up phone modem from the '80s.<br /><br />To setup the camera, you must remove the SD card and run a program on your computer.  The configuration settings are not clear and sometimes seem buggy.  If you only needed to set this up once, it wouldn't be too bad.  But the company recommends that you update/format the SD card with their firmware tool EVERY WEEK!!!  That means you need to set up all of your settings again, every week.<br /><br />While the camera will theoretically record over the oldest videos, it saves any video it associates with an important \\""event\\"", which is designated by G-force accelerometer.  Since the accelerometer is fairly sensitive, it ends up saving (i.e., not recording over) a large number of videos, such as every time you speed up or take a corner.  After a short time, your card will fill up with \\""saved\\"" videos and the camera will refuse to record any more.  The only way to clear the SD card is to remove it from the camera, connect it to your computer, navigate through the folders on the card to you find the one containing all the videos, then delete all the videos.  Crazy.<br /><br />The wifi and iPhone app sound cool on paper, but are basically useless.  The camera sends out its own wifi network that you must first join with your iPhone before their app will work.  However, that means that every time you get in your car, your phone will connect to that network preventing your phone from downloading any data (i.e., your phone thinks it's connected to a wifi network connected to the internet, even though it isn't).  That means, no GPS navigation via phone, no Imessages, no internet radio, etc.  Even when I was connected, the app wouldn't play back video properly on my iPhone 5.  It would play a second or two, then stop.  It seems like their video format doesn't conform to Apple's standards.<br /><br />The only upside to this camera is that the picture quality is decent and it records both GPS location data and speed data, so while you are watching a video, you can see how fast and where you were driving.<br /><br />This camera had potential to be pretty cool based on its features, but its very poor implementation, non-existent support, and high price tag make this one to avoid.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Be warned, you don't actually get warranty support.  I finally received an email back from the main Blackvue webpage (blackvue dot com) which said that I should contact the distributor that I bought my camera from for warranty support.  Since I bought from Amazon in the US, it appears that the distributor is \\""blackvueusa\\"", who states that unless you purchased directly from them, they will not honor the warranty (they claim the market is flooded with fakes and therefore they can't tell if yours is genuine).  I will probably be reporting this company to the California Attorney General's office for the deceptive business practice of failing to honor their advertised warranty.",16111.0

We changed the batteries to no avail. I'm really quite angry. What am I supposed to do...take  out the whole thing, send it back, and pay to have a replacement installed again? I think not. So I'm just drealing with an absolute turd. Sometimes we can't even get the remote to work after banging on things and have to enter the car using the key...which sets off the alarm an wakes up the neigbors at 4:30 in the morning when I leave for work. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Again, this is the ONLY Viper product I've had that I wouldn't give 5 stars. I think I just got a lemon.",16109.0

Three of the five are grid readers.  The first grid reader is a 1:24,000 1km UTM style with 100 meter square divisions.  The rectangular shape makes it odd for me to work with being used to the normal square ones.  Because of this they included a 1/2mile scale and acre scale.  I don't find either very useful as everything being in kilometers figuring out in miles is just a math calculation away and probably more accurate.  The next grid reader has a 1:50k and 1:100k scale and the last grid reader has 1:25k and 1:250k scale.  The last two cards are on one of my square &#34;Pocket Corners&#34; map tools.  So in other words this could have been done on two and not three cards.  Also the cards do not have any holes in the center for placing a pencil point.  This is a must if you are trying to find an azimuth.  Another thing that makes these cards hard to impossible to use for finding an azimuth on a map is the border is clear like the rest of the reader.  Most of these map tools have a white with black lettering for degree reading along the edge.<br /><br />Card number one with printing on side one contains a basic symbol set, contour line explanation, and conversions.  The most helpful part of this card to me is the conversions sections which covers meters to yards and km to miles and a few others.  The symbol set might be marginally helpful to get your brain working.  The contour line explanation is worthless.  Not that it is wrong but that it is so basic I see no reason anyone with a little experience with topo maps would need it.<br /><br />Side two of card one has a pace count section, a declination explanation, and how to travel an azimuth.  Pace count is worthless as everyone's pace count is different and this does not tell you how to find it but just gives you a general idea of what yours might be.  Don't expect this to be your pace count and should not even be on the card.  The declination explanation is fine but can easily be summed up as &#34;West is best and East is least&#34; meaning you add if declination is west and subtract if it is east.  Travel and azimuth explanation is acceptable and you should be able to do so reading this card.  However if you need this depth of help you probably don't know enough to know what to do if you have an azimuth or how to get the azimuth from map to compass.<br /><br />The last printed card gives an explanation of using a UTM on a map on side one and side two is generic survival tips.  What really had my laughing was side one tells you how to use a UTM with a GPS and side two says never rely on a GPS.  Go Figure.<br /><br />Your money is better spent on reading the book The Essential Wilderness Navigator by David and Cleveland.  Lots of places have orienteering clubs and some outdoors stores even offer free classes.  Once you have a little experience and a better quality UTM square the little hints these cards provide will not be needed.",16107.0

Most dash cam owners see a picture on the screen and the light was flashing saying it was recording and you really do not need any recordings unless you are in an accident which I was.<br /><br />The police were called and the other lady driving had a totally different story trying to make it my fault. I told the officer that I had it all on my dash cam and video does not lie so I took it down and tried to play the accident back to show she was at fault.<br /><br />Come to find out my the camera only videoed the 15 minutes inside my house and nothing afterwards. All the 6 months time the camera said it was recording with the red flashing light and the LCD display but the camera was defective.<br /><br />I was furious that I was lucky that we each had to pay our own damage since there was no recording to prove what happened and that cost me $1,400 but the real frustrating part was trying to get the manufacturer to just replace it with a good one so I wrote several letters to them and they said they would replace it if I would send the camera all the way back to China which takes 30 days each way.<br /><br />The owner of the company said to ship it so I shipped it first class and certified for about $14.00. I then waited over a month to see if they had received the bad camera and they said they had not. I waited a few more weeks for sure allowing time for the camera to get to them and nothing.<br /><br />After dealing with this broken camera for over a year I contacted Amazon customer support and they read all of my E mails and saw where the manufacturer said months later that he would replace it with a new one but did not.<br /><br />I requested that this company be terminated from doing business with Amazon because there is no telling how many people that got bad cameras because the company said they had lots of defects with this model and I even said I would pay the difference if they had a nicer model if they were sure it would work.<br /><br />You can read my reviews and 90% are positive and I have to give Amazon two big thumbs up for dealing with this problem and hopefully saving others from running in to this same problem !ld pay the difference if they had a nicer model if they were sure it would work.

After more careful consideration on the price ($110 is $110 theae days) I decided to go ahead and take the plunge.<br /><br />The first few days were great and neat and exciting and fun, except the GPS didn't seem to be reliable. Then the camera just stopped recording. I thought it might be the card so I went back on YouTube and watched the video again. I realized that I wasn't doing anything wrong and reinstalled the camera into my car. Sometimes it records and sometimes it doesn't so I have to spend 5 to 10 minutes everytime I get into my car to get it recording, whether that means deleting files to free up room or just messing with the buttons until it records again.<br /><br />I am running it with a 32G class 10 and I have it on a 3 minute loop and it just stops when the card is full. No warning, no beep, nothing. The YouTube review said it has about 5 hours of recording time.

I am a 35 year old man who won my fantasy football league last year and decided to by the remote control car I always wanted since I was a kid.  After a number of days researching different products, I settle on the Slash 4X4 from Traxxas.<br />I was super excited when it arrived and opened it, charged it up and followed directions to a T.  The car worked great, and was everything I wanted in a remote control car; fast, rugged, good looking, and battery operated.<br />After using the car 4 times, I went to plug it in for a charge and the Electronic Speed Control (VXL-3s) started to smoke.  I unplugged it immediately and looked online to why this may happen.  To my disappointment, it seems the Slash has this issue, with a number of users seeing this problem after only a few uses.  I thought this would be something that was covered by warranty, so I called up customer service.  To my disappointment, their warranty is only for 30 days, and if I want a new part, it will cost me an additional $55.  Asked why this happens and the service rep replay is &#34;it’s an electrical part, all electrical parts break just like a light bulb.  Some bulbs go out after one use while others after 10,000 uses.&#34;  What total BS.  I have never had a light bulb go out after 4 uses.  But whatever, I paid the money and have to send the part in for a new one.  So, while I would have given this car 5 stars plus, the fact it broke after only a few uses by someone who took extra care to do everything right, and who is a recreational user at best, and for the company to not stand by their product, I have to regretfully give it 1 star.  If I knew it had these issues, I would have never bought this car and would instead bought something more reliable.",16059.0

She thought i would love this geeky device. Sadly, i didn't. First time in my life, I returned a gift. I hope she will forgive me for this.<br /><br />This device is conceptually very nice. But I want to discuss its capabilities here.<br />- A toy is supposed to be fun and functional. This is neither. Play for 15 min and you will notice this stuff is getting boring. Unless you also enjoy watching your washing machine, there is no point of playing with this.<br />- Controlling app doesn't give you much to do. You just roll it out, as if haters gonna hate. I don't get it. Pointless function and pointless app.<br />- The other available apps do not provide any creativity as well. Playing games with a toy... oh yeah? Augmented reality? Even CoD:Ghosts should be more exciting than this. (I should admit, there is one measurement app that is creative.)<br />- SDK is poor. No community. I assume developing something on this device is already a dead end. This device is around market for two years. I invite you to count apps/programs that are not developed by Orbotix.<br />- Although Orbotix claims it is programmable, it is not. Yes you can send direct commands such as go left right etc. But what I understand from programming for this device is, creating an autonomous self-decisive device that can decide what to do when it is excited with some sort of input. There is no way to do such a thing. All decision can only be made by the pairing device. When firmware becomes open-source and codes will be deployable to the ball, then i will eat my hat.<br />- I guess the biggest bomb here is paying over 100$ for this. Does not worth it.<br /><br />Dear girlfriends/fiancees/wives of the world; I am beginning you. Don't do it. Don't buy this device for your men. It will only bring sadness and misery to their one-dimensional lives.<br /><br />EDIT: I had to pay $17 for returning this (bought from brookstone). If fiancee paid that much for shipping cost, we end up with nothing for $34. Thanks for nothing.<br /><br />DON'T BUY IT!!!",16055.0

First of all, I didn't pay any attention to where it was coming from.  Learn from my mistake.  This item is shipped from CHINA.  It takes a month to receive it.  When I received it I couldn't understand the user's manual because it was in some sort of mangled Chinenglish that didn't make sense.  Then I learned the operating temps for this unit is 32F to 104F.  Where can you go in the U.S. that never goes below 32 and never goes above 104 (in an automobile)?  I decided I would return the unit before I even used it.  That was a huge undertaking.  If you return something to this seller, you have to send it first class USPS.  There is no way to insure or track USPS first class and this item is too heavy to send that method anyway.  Try to solve that little fiasco with people who understand little English and live on the other side of the planet.  Amazon was no help.  They kept telling me to send it back via a insurable and trackable method ($120 for me).  Telling Amazon that I refuse to return a $106 item and pay $120 for the shipping while telling EPRANCE that it is impossible to send the unit back per their instructions caused a month's worth of e-mails and phone calls that had me incredible frustrated.  I finally got the item returned after tons of headaches.

It functioned just fine in that capacity for a couple of weeks. (Note: for those who are expecting some kind of earth-shaking miniature boom box, this is not it. It was plenty loud for my purposes - i.e., could hear the music just fine at regular cruising velocity, but it's not like it could power your pool party unless you had exceptionally mellow guests). I never had need for the Bluetooth functionality (it was just for listening to my iPod), but ironically, this was the G-GRIP's downfall. I had the unit out of the convertible and was hooking it up to my bike for a downhill race event, and the Bluetooth &#34;pairing&#34; function started wigging out for no reason whatsoever. Just flickering blue light, no sound, which prevented it from being able to function in ANY other capacity. Plugging in the aux cable didn't help. Turning it on and off didn't help. Nor did the factory reset kill switch, nor letting it run itself completely out of battery. It was just permanently lunched. And for nothing! I didn't drop it, abuse it, or get it wet.

The first radio started just resetting randomly loosing all programming.  I called the dealer and he told me the problem was known and Wouxun had fixed the problem in new units.  In late August I purchased another KG-UVD1P from Amazon.  I thought since Wouxun knew what the problem was back in 2011 that surely the new one would have the &#34;fix&#34; and I had extra accessories I had bought for my first unit.  To my surprise the new unit has now started failing the same way.  I looked at the warranty card and it required a dealer stamp and was two weeks late on being returned.  So I guess I'm out of luck.  I know it's only $105 but it starts to add up after a while.  I would not purchase any of Wouxun products after this experience.,15987.0

Direct from the FCC :<br /><br />The FCC's Office of Engineer and Technology (OET) has evaluated the devices listed below and has concluded that these devices are not only amateur transceivers but can easily be altered for use as Citizens Band (CB) transceivers as well. As such, OET has further concluded that these devices cannot legally be imported or marketed within the United States for the reasons discussed below. Further, the FCC General Council has issued a decision in a specific case involving one manufacturer and has concluded that dual use CB and amateur radios of the kind at issue may not be approved under the Commission's rules and are in violation of several rules including the RF power level limits of 47 CFR 95.639. (letter from Christopher J. Wright, FCC-OGC to John F. Atwood, US Customs Service, dated May 17, 1999).<br /><br />Transceivers used in the Amateur Radio Service below 30 MHz do not require FCC authorization prior to being imported into or marketed within the United States, but transceivers for other services, including the CB Radio Service (CB), do require Commission approval. The transceivers listed herein and other similar models operate in the amateur \\""10-meter band\\"" and are often referred to as \\""10-meter\\"" radios or \\""export\\"" radios. The amateur 10-meter band uses frequencies that are very close to the channels set aside for use in the CB service. Some of the transceivers that manufacturers call \\""10-meter\\"" radios either operate on CB frequencies as manufactured and imported or are designed such that internal circuits can readily be activated by a user, a service technician or a dealer to operate on CB frequencies. According to Section 95.603(c) of the Commission's rules, a CB transmitter is a transmitter that operates or is intended to operate at a station authorized for the CB service. 47C.F.R. § 95.603(c). The Commission's equipment authorization experts in the FCC Laboratory have determined that the transceivers listed herein and other similar models at issue here are intended for use on the CB frequencies as well as those in the amateur service because they have built-in capability to operate on CB frequencies. This capability can be readily activated by moving or removing a jumper plug, cutting or splicing a wire, plugging in a connector, or other simple means. Thus, all the transceivers listed herein and similar models fall within the definition of a CB transmitter. See 47C.F.R. § 95.603(c). A CB transmitter must be certificated by the FCC prior to marketing or importation. 47 C.F.R. §§ 95.603(c); 2.803.<br /><br />Moreover, the dual use CB and amateur radios of the kind at issue here may not be certified under the Commission's rules. Section 95.655(a) states: \\""....([CB] Transmitters with frequency capability for the Amateur Radio Services ... will not be certificated.)\\"" See also Amendment of Part 95, Subpart E, Technical Regulations in the Personal Radio Services Rules, FCC 88-256, 1888 WL 488084 (August 17, 1988). This clarification was added to explicitly foreclose the possibility of certification of dual use CB and amateur radios, see id, and thereby deter use by CB operators of frequencies allocated for amateur radio use.<br /><br />In addition, the Commission's equipment authorization experts have determined that these devices violate or appear to violate a number of the rules governing CB devices. For example, they may use emission types not permitted, or emit RF power at a level in excess of the levels permitted in the CB radio service. See 47 C.F.R. § 95.639.<br /><br />In view of the foregoing, the following \\""10-meter\\"" transceivers are not acceptable for importation or marketing into/within the United States. Importation and marketing of these units is illegal pursuant to Section 302(b) of the Communications Act and Section 2.803 of the rules. Willful violations of the Rules and the Act may subject the violator to a monetaryforfeiture of not more than $11,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation. The Commission continues to review this type of equipment, and additional makes and models may be added to this list in the future.",15984.0

The visibility during normal sunlight ranged from none to barely visible after an extended stare.<br /><br />By comparison, only occasionally - maybe two or three times a year - did my standard Honda Radio display get washed out given the right amount of Sun light and its direction.<br /><br />About the controls, they are not very intuitive.  This would not be a problem except that I have to constantly adjust the brightness using the menu settings to activate the dimmer option (the front panel dimmer button only works if you only use Brightness Level 4 or lower).

Radio signal was weak for me but radio functions work fine. Reverse cam I installed works fine.<br />But these things are not why I bought an appradio specifically, so let me explain my one star review.<br /><br />1st off when you finally get all the adaptors you need (depending on your phone's compatibility) which are never included and cost extra, you realize that when you plug it in none of the apps work together - you can't use GPS while using a music app. Yes thats right, you can't listen to music while using one of the 3 terrible options for GPS navigation apps. Steering wheel functions also don't integrate in app mode(I paid for an adaptor). You need to use the pioneer keyboard for anything to work, and its pretty terrible so it requires switching back and forth when you connect and disconnect appradio. Next you'll notice that the screen mirroring doesn't allow use of the touchscreen unless you're using app mode using one of the approved apps (there are about 15 apps offered altogether and they are also almost 100% crap, a lot of fluff and stuff your phone does so much better on its own - I had hoped for more useful driving related apps). Next is that your phone needs to be in landscape mode otherwise you get a tiny portrait view of your screen in the middle of the appradio display. When turning off screen rotation my phone locks in portrait mode, so I need to have my phone fixed somewhere laying horizontally, there's no option to force screen to stay in landscape mode OR to dim or turn the screen off. While your smartphone screen is being mirrored on the appradio display, your phone's screen stays on draining the battery, and the mhl port barely charges the battery at all, certainly not fast enough to maintain while using the bluetooth and with the display staying on it makes your battery drain fast even when plugged in. Again, you can't use any of the phone functions on the appradio touchscreen unless you're using your phone in appradio mode AND an approved app. The only way to get a real usable mirror image on your appradio display is by using ARLiberator, this is the ONLY option to have your appradio work the way it should (allowing you to use the functions of your phone through a mirrored image of your screen, the audio and video and multitouch controls of all the functions and apps on your phone in the car). Either way, ARLiberator is another 30-35$ and only works with appradio 2 - so its still useless for those of us unfortunate enough to have made the mistake of buying AR3 (and it seems ARLiberator has been pretty much abandoned by developers so not much chance of getting an update to support AR3). After finally convincing myself to accept that arliberator and my appradio would never work the way I hoped and thought, I decided I would just change the background and use the appradio in its basic mode, which still allows me to Bluetooth stream audio with full control from my steering wheel, and just continue using my phone for GPS navigation.. I told myself I could live with that, disappointed, but I would live with it and just hope someone at Pioneer or ARliberator someday decides to keep developing software so I can use this setup to its potential. All I want now is a nice Audi logo. After lots of research, I come to find out I can't even change my background. Apparently only Appradio 1 can do this via its micro sd card slot which neither appradio 2 or 3 models have.<br />I took out the mhl port, I use the USB only to charge my phone which works much better than when attached to the mhl port. Its only a radio with BT and a screen for my reverse camera. So many other options out there but I got this for APPRADIO! To connect my phone to my head unit and get different apps and functions to work with my in car display! Disappointed..<br /><br />Summary: hardware is decent, potential is there BUT pioneer has done way too little to further the development of the product so that this thing can actually do what its capable of. Nothing was impressive, nothing can be customized, nothing works properly as its advertised. As a basic radio its fine, Bluetooth audio streaming is good, reverse cam is good, but there's absolutely no video unless you get the DVD version then you can play DVD videos. Arliberator does for appradio 2 what pioneer should have done for all the appradios. On its own, appradio as provided by Pioneer is almost useless, whatever it does - it does poorly. Nothing like you're supposed to expect as its been advertised and certainly nothing that makes it worth paying for - its a waste of money as cheaper and better designed products with the same basic functions exist. ARLiberator with appradio 2 is apparently the only worthwhile setup, but I don't feel like Pioneer deserves to sell ANY of these units considering the only way for them to work properly or satisfactorily was provided by an independent team of developers. I wish those developers would continue working on their software so that I didn't have to feel like I completely wasted my money. MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.<br /><br />Also BTW, when contacting tech support from Pioneer not only did I discover they're not open during convenient hours (while you're busy at work they're ready to take your call but then when you get home and have time to work on stuff they are closed), but the agents were all completely useless and knew nothing. I knew so much more than any of the 3 people I had the privilege of speaking with, which is sad considering I had barely done any research at that point. Finally when I concluded they couldn't help me they offered to send an email to a specialist and get back to me within a couple of days. Finally a month or so after the call someone sends me an email from a no-reply address one sentence long not answering any of the questions I had asked. Useless information, nothing to do with my issue. As of now, I don't think I will never buy another Pioneer product.",15956.0

Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service.  I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.",15953.0

I followed the poorly written and illustrated instruction booklet that accompanied the speaker, and, at first, after some trouble pairing it with my Apple MacBook's Bluetooth, it finally worked and sounded--fine.  Not great, not bad, just fine.  Bass wasn't that great, sounded a bit distorted at times, especially at full volume (which wasn't as loud as I would've expected from other reviewers' reviews).  I wasn't thrilled, but I wasn't going to return it, either.  It was...fine.  But then it started to drop the pairing, and go silent.  I would start from scratch, re-pairing it with my laptop, and the same thing would happen again, leaving it a silent paperweight instead of a speaker.  I then went to the included instruction booklet to troubleshoot the problem, but the booklet that came with it was hilariously inadequate at troubleshooting answers--so I naturally went to the company's website.  There I was surprised to find the website was inadequate at troubleshooting as well--and then I also realized no phone number was given at that company's website--you had to contact them by email (first red flag).  I did so, and, to my relief, they did contact me within two days, and we started to correspond about the ongoing problem.  At first the correspondence was friendly, detailed, and mutually respectful, but as time went on and the problem continued (plus there turned out to be even more problems as we tried to fix it), I was finally told there were some known problems with some models of Apple MacBooks, and that it wasn't the speaker's fault.  Well, fine, but why isn't that noted on the sales page for the speaker or at the company's website so those of us who happen to have those MacBook models don't order the speaker in the firstplace?  When I mentioned that, I received no reply, and that's when I also realized the person who had been writing me had never given me their name (second red flag) or a contact phone number to speed things up.  When I then wrote back--twice--to simply (and kindly) ask if they were saying this speaker would never work reliably with my particular MacBook I subsequently received no replies to either email (when in comparison replies had been coming within an hour or so prior to this).  It became obvious that they were dumping me, had no plans to offer a refund, and I was on my own--with a $50 paperweight.  The good news:  I contacted Amazon directly (please note that it turns out you are NOT ordering through Amazon when you hit the \\""Buy\\"" button here--the order will not show up on your Order History in your Amazon account, and they will have trouble helping you should you have a similar problem to mine), and, after two phone calls, everything was resolved beautifully (Bottom line: I love Amazon's customer service--but not Cambridge Soundworks' customer service). So, good luck if you order from Cambridge Soundworks--I've been a fan of their speakers and prices in the past, but I will not be ordering from them again.",15940.0

First, please take note that this product only has a 30 DAY WARRAMTY (not a good policy for a quality product).<br /><br />Here is the rundown<br />  There are no installation instructions, luckily I have some knowledge of electronics so it only took me about 2 hours to completely install these monitors.  The thing that took the most time was having to figure out which wires connected to what.  After I got them installed, the kids LOVED them, but this was short lived.  On our first trip with these monitors the first issue began to surface (a small issue, but still an issue).  The resume playback feature on one of the monitors began working very occasionally and there were some headphone and remote issues I will explain in a little later.  So after this trip I contacted Amazon and opted for a partial refund on the dvd headrest monitors because the playback feature is a minor (aggravating) issue that we could deal with.<br /><br />  A few weeks later, the opposite dvd monitor began having issues loading a disc.  Sometimes it will load a disc, and sometimes it will not load a disc (not a good thing when it is for a 5 year old).  So I contacted amazon again and they have made an exception for me to return these monitors for a refund because the 30 day warranty on the product has expired (I should have noticed the short warranty when I ordered the product, I will look at that more carefully before ordering a replacement).<br /><br />Now, a few issues with the product that you may want to know before ordering.<br />  1.  The FM system that allows it to work over the vehicle sound system is not very good.  The sound is very low and there is a lot of static (and I tried all of the channels)<br /><br />  2.  The monitors themselves do not tilt, the entire headrest tilts which is not friendly for the passenger in the front seat.<br /><br />  3.  Being able to watch 2 separate movies or even play games on them is nice, but be aware that while there is an A/B channel for the headphones, there is only one channel for the remotes.  While one child is playing a video game on their monitor, if they turn their controller just a little too much, it will affect the play of the dvd or game on the opposite monitor.  This issue causes a lot of complaining by young children who cannot understand why their movie stopped in the middle of their favorite scene.<br /><br />  4.  The picture quality is just fair.  it is not anything to brag about.  it is fine for vehicle TV's, but it is NOT HD.<br /><br />  5.  The headphones that come with the monitors are extremely cheap.  I have already had to replace one pair in the first 2 weeks.  the pair I ordered to replace them was a much higher quality and not that much more expensive.<br /><br />  6.  Lack of instructions.  This if from install through product function.  prepare to spend time figuring it out on your own.<br /><br />Hope this helps.",15928.0

It did not work.  Time stayed at 00:00.  So I had to set it up manually, typically not a big deal, but more about that in a minute.<br /><br />I figured that it might have to do with an outdated version of the software that runs everything (version 3.1.2 ) so I selected the software update option.  I received an \\""Error\\"" message, each and every time tried it.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the internet radio.  I was excited to be able to pull my favorite stations from the internet and things were going great.  That is until the software crashed during a station search.  The crash caused the software to reboot itself.<br /><br />After the software rebooted, my saved settings and stations came back but NOT the clock settings, which I had to manually enter again (otherwise it blinks \\""00:00\\"" like an old VCR).  I ended up doing this a lot because the internet radio crashed repeatedly - whether during a search, a station change, browsing stations, it crashed, causing the software to reboot each and every time - rendering this feature useless.<br /><br />I then went to the website to check the tech support page, except there isn't one.  There is a support email page (no phone numbers) where you can select 'sales/support' and fill in a text box to describe the problem.  An auto-generated response email is then sent back stating \\""We have received your inquiry and will assign the appropriate team member to get back to you within 48 hours\\"". I'm still waiting.<br /><br />My whole experience leaves me feeling that it was released before it was ready.  I did try the FM Tuner and the Bluetooth connectivity - which both worked initially.  I did not use them as much as the internet radio.  My experience with the radio did not give me confidence withany of the other features.<br /><br />I really was hoping for the best with the  Ambiance 2, however it left me disappointed and frustrated.

Doesn't do well to mild heat, warranty is useless - no help from manufacturer or reseller.<br /><br />Died on me within four months of use. I suspect heat was the problem. My vehicle is in the SF bay area, so in general its pretty mild weather. We had a short heat wave two weeks ago (88-92 degree weather), and the camera stopped working properly. It appears that the GPS sub-system died. Since you can't set the clock (time of date is set with GPS), so every file and video timestamp was dated with a Unix EPOCH 1969 date. Using it in sunny 75 degree weather was not a problem, although the device would be very hot to touch.<br /><br />I tried filing a warranty claim and it was a total waste of time. The manufacturer points you to the reseller and the reseller pointed me to the manufacturer (I bought from a marketplace vendor instead of amazon.com). Though, its not like amazon's standard return policy would have helped after 4 months of usage.<br /><br />The wifi is mildly interesting, but difficult to use. It acts as a infrastructure base station, but it obviously does not route to a real network. Connecting via iPhone means you can connect to camera, and launch the app to interact with the camera. However, the annoying part is you need to &#34;forget&#34; the network right after unless you want your iPhone to not have a network when you're around the camera. Also the wifi appears to randomly not connect properly. I know my phone has the SSID and password saved, can scan for the SSID, but it simply does not connect. Very frustrating.<br /><br />So the pros: The build quality of the device is rather good. The mount is very well thought out and the cable is long enough for me to connect to the CLA in the center console of my full sized truck. Image quality during the day is excellent. I thought night shots were good enough. Very wide angle lens. Packaging is like an Apple product.<br /><br />Software: The desktop software is decent (I used the Mac version). The iPhone application is a little cheezy, but it does the job.<br /><br />If you make the mistake of buying this camera, at least look to a Square Trade warranty (you'll need it :) ).<br /><br />I'm going to try the Lukas 7900. Its spec'd to work up to 180 degrees F. Cheaper, also S Korean built. I'll use the savings to buy a SD card to camera kit for the iPad.",15903.0

I compared the quality with my JVC Everio GZ-HM320BU camera that records in 1080p AVCHD and no match.  Not even close.  I also compared it to the my HS25EXR Fuji's 1080p and no comparison in image quality.  If you know what 1080p looks like, this camera is nothing near it.  Unless you haven't ever seen a good quality video.  The video quality of this camera is not even acceptable.

I thought the Nook would be a great gift for her, after reading reviews here on Amazon that it can download and read free ebooks from library sites. Our local library offers ebooks so I thought it would be great.<br /><br />After getting the Nook, I learned a number of things:<br /><br />1. The Nook does NOT have a browser. It can only connect to the Barnes and Noble online bookstore.<br />2. You are REQUIRED to have a valid credit card, even to download free content.<br />3. While there is a way to root (hack) the Nook and thus enable a functional browser, it voids the warranty and is way too complicated to follow. I shouldn't have to hack a device to enable such a basic functionality.<br /><br />My mother isn't very computer savvy, and doesn't own a credit card, so I couldn't give her something like this. If it let you connect to library sites and download library books for free, it would be an ideal ereader. In it's current form, it's an overly-complicated money sinkhole. Now I'm out $70 and I still need to buy my mother a birthday present.<br /><br />I don't know why some of these other reviewers claim it can be used to download library ebooks. Claiming that a device has a functionality that it in fact does not have, is a really despicable thing to do.<br /><br />If you don't mind a wireless device owning a copy of your credit card, and throwing money at it to read books, then the Barnes & Noble Nook is right for you.

This changed today.  We ordered my son and daughter each an MP3 player for a road trip.  My son ordered the orange 4gb Sansa Clip Zip without issue.  My issue is with the actual box this entire order came in along with the product we received for my daughter.<br /><br />We ordered the SanDisk 4GB Sansa CLIP+ MP3 Player PURPLE Bundle w/ 4GB MicroSDHC Card (8GB Total) amp; BlueProton USB 2.0 Reader.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QYR7OQ/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />We received both MP3 players in one shipment in a pathetic excuse for a box.  I could see in from both sides and could easily pull open either side and take out both players.  This is sub par on Amazon's part.  Like I said, my son's orange Clip Zip was in the factory packaging and was perfect.  My daughters player came in a white box labeled with:<br /><br />-SanDisk 4GB Sansa CLIP+ MP3 Player<br />-SDMX18R-004G PURPLE<br />-SanDisk 4GB microSDHC Card<br />-BluePhoton 3in1 Reader<br /><br />It also said \\""Certified Frustration-Free Packaging\\""<br /><br />The MP3 player was in a little bubble wrap bag.  The clip was broken off the back of the player.  It also had an \\""R\\"" stamped on the clip meaning it is refurbished.  No where on the product page did it describe this unit as being refurbished.  We paid for a new unit.  The USB port was the older USB 2.0 Type B Jack as opposed to the new usb 2.0 Micro Type B jack of the current players. The microSD card was loose and sliding all around in a plastic SD card holder.  We didn't receive a CD or paper manual, just a printed label with misspelled words and url's for firmware and manual.<br /><br />This is my worst experience with this company.

They claim their generic battery will work unmodified on the UV-5R series of radios (their justification for the switch), but it doesn't.  See my Baofeng Extended Battery review for more info).<br /><br />Yes, you can modify (on your own) the Extended Battery so it will fit the UV-5RA (or the other series of UV-5R radios with modified faceplates), but if the \\""distributor\\"" lists the UV-5R (but then switches your order to whatever they have in stock - instead of what they have listed) and then ships (in the same order) a generic clone Extended Battery that isn't the actual Baofeng AND doesn't work/fit with the radio they shipped, why is it your job to modify their items to make them work?<br /><br />In addition, when you (as an Amazon customer) point out their multiple listing errors (shipping a non-Baofeng battery, shipping a less than advertised 3600mAH model (vs. the actual Baofeng 3800mAH model that was advertised on the listing), and shipping an Extended Battery that won't work on the UV-5RA radios that they switched your order to and shipped with them in the same box), they claim that:<br /><br />a) Baofeng doesn't even make an Extended Battery (funny since I own several already with Baofeng Electronics' label on the inside of the case and Baofeng's name imprinted into the back of the plastic battery case), and that<br /><br />b) if I'm not happy I should pay to ship my order back to them (this is how they treat a customer that ordered multiple radios, extended batteries, and programming cables all at once and paid over $117 in shipping fees)?<br /><br />None of these issues may bother some folks, especially those that either don't care which model of radio they get and/or never plan to get an Extended Battery as an accessory, but I wanted folks to know what customer service issues you may face in dealing with this Baofeng \\""distributor\\"" in KY.case), and that<br /><br />b) if I'm not happy I should pay to ship my order back to them (this is how they treat a customer that ordered multiple radios, extended batteries, and programming cables all at once and paid over $117 in shipping fees)?<br /><br />None of these issues may bother some folks, especially those that either don't care which model of radio they get and/or never plan to get an Extended Battery as an accessory, but I wanted folks to know what customer service issues you may face in dealing with this Baofeng \\""distributor\\"" in KY.",15785.0

Then there is the problem with playing songs it loads them up but if you turn the car off to run into the store it resets the entire list and you have to start skipping songs you just listened to.<br /><br />USB integration, this is just a joke it lists 198 files period doesn't matter how many folders you set the songs in they just list 198 files and it randomly picks a letter to start at I've had 0-G and it started at B then did A C then nothing else and it didn't list many songs from the ones it did have I've tried renaming the files to ISO standard naming but nothing I have no idea how this software works but they defiantly screwed it up.<br /><br />Video, I never tried the dvd disc but I did have to go through a few conversions to get video to actually show up and work, First off you HAVE TO HAVE an mp4 file on the flashdrive doesn't matter what it is but if there is no mp4 file it will say there are no videos on it, even though you could have 3gigs of videos on there it will say there isn't a single one, Next it will not play a single MP4 video file no matter what it has to be VCD Mpg format and they will play perfectly fine but only if they are VCDMPG format anything else and the video will either skip not show up or have green blocks all over the place.<br /><br />Bluetooth, I don't care much for the phone portion but I tried it out to stream music to, This is another joke I got it to connect, then about 10 seconds later it disconnected and I tried it 5 times but always the samething, it would connect but always say no link but my phone said connected play music for about 10 seconds then disconnected.<br /><br />Radio, can't screw this up it's a standard radio.<br /><br />Clock, How you can get this wrong I have no clue but they did. It doesn't display the time except when you press display on the remote or start it up and catch the quick glimps of it. it never shows up any other time and it randomly jumps between imperial and military time. You turn it on and it says 1:30, turn it on 10 minutes later it's 14:30, I tried to set it once and for some reason it could jump up to 30:45 I'm guessing it goes up to 99:99 for whatever reason.<br /><br />In conclusion I would say to stay as far away from this as you can, spend some extra money and get a decent one that has software from the past 5 years cause this is bad even for 1998 I tend to think windows 95 is more advanced then the software on this.",15785.0

However, if you drive more than a few minutes you will be messing with this thing. In loop mode, (1,2, or 3 minutes) it will only loop a couple times and quit. You have to power it off and restart it to get it going again. If shooting continous mode the longest I had it recording was 9 minutes and 30 seconds before it quit. Also quite of few of the files did not play back on my PC. I am using a 32GB class 10 card in it and it still freezes, quits recording or has unviewable files. I have an hour commute one way, I can not be restarting this thing every few minutes only to have 30% of the files not play back. As far as night driving.

It has great sound (For me, at least, I'm not an audiophile, I just want to play my Mp3 music. High freq hearing loss precludes getting picky w/ sound quality.)but from the start stuff just didn't seem right. I have 2 Mp3 players: a Samsung YP-P3 & an iPod Nano (7th gen.) I'm going to list the problems I had & then the response support gave me.<br />1. Start booklet says blue LED light indicates unit is on; mine never came on when unit was turned on.<br />Support response: blue light doesn't come on to indicate unit is on.<br />2. Even though pairing wasn't a problem i couldn't get either player to connect w/o pushing the source button after turning the unit on. (I hand to push it for so long that the speaker went into pairing mode-this occurred for both players.) This was the only mode where I could get sound. Obviously the constant flashing red/blue pairing light was very distracting.<br />Support response: \\""I didn't know iPod Nano had bluetooth.\\"" After research & a callback support told me that w/ Apple products the pairing lights would continue to flash but that was normal. Why then, I asked, was it doing the same with the Samsung also. No acceptable answer was given<br />Since I have a low BS Quotient-support person either didn't know what she was talking about or there are issues she didn't know about w/ 7th gen. Nanos (it is, BTW, the 1st Nano w/ BT so I might expect that.)- I opted to return the unit (At my expense, BTW, a fact I didnt learn until they emailed my return instructions. By that time I was fed up w/ the whole thing & just sent it back for a refund.) I don't believe normal operation only occurs in pairing mode & if blue LED isn't supposed to come on to indicate the unit IS on then don't say so in the instructions. It was a very frustrating experience & I didn't want to try an exchange for another unit (probably get a refurb anyway.) or reorder. Still, I've got to say the sound wasgood.",15701.0

After much phone time, they saw that I had a record of purchase for just this year. Then I began going through their lengthy bureaucratic process to get a replacement. At the end, they demanded that I pay for the replacement, with my money to be refunded when my old one is sent back. I said no--no way was I going to trust B&N with more of my money. So they said I could do this exchange at a store. Unfortunately, the closest store has closed, and another is 70 plus miles away, but I don't have much choice. I said OK, I'd do this exchange at that store, but probably it would take me a couple of months before I traveled to that area. No problem, they said. That'll be fine. Then they sent me an email that said, Do this right away, the replacement will be good for only a limited time!<br /><br />Meanwhile, I have a largely useless device for which I paid almost $100. Will I ever get a working device? Well, for over 3 months, I have not and I'm not optimistic. I guess I will just toss it and get a Kindle--except that I don't much trust Amazon to stand behind that product either!<br /><br />Don't get a Nook; don't expect help from Amazon if you do.",15679.0

My regular portable Garmin 1450 LMT has already updated it right after the change; but my Kenwood unit says it is still current.

It has different makes of motherboards that are compatible with different batteries. The battery shown is only compatible with a battery having the same number on it. I purchased this battery while I was ignorant to this fact without checking mine and now have a useless battery. I have tested it on multiple logic boards and some have worked but in order for you to be sure of what you are ordering and to get the best out of what you buy I recommend opening the iphone 3GS and checking what battery your iPhone came with. Then search the number along with the description.<br /><br />Thanks everyone.<br />Edward,15631.0

After installing the 1300a amplifier, I realized I needed to get a line level control so that I could adjust the bass on the fly. I couldn't believe how expensive the control's were, nor could I believe that you could only get them on amazon and ebay, and that there was only one supplier: Woofersetc.  So I rang up Harman, the makers of Infinity, and asked how best to get the control. They informed me that for $17.48 I could get the controller and cable, including shipping, directly from Harman. So I am writing this to inform anybody who is thinking that it's a good idea to buy this control, that it's really a total rip-off. Each time somebody buys a remote from Woofersetc, they tack on a bunch of cost for no reason. So let's just say it actually costs $5.89 to ship it. For doing nothing other than calling Harman and ordering the remote and then shipping it to you, Woodersetc makes a free and clear profit of $25.12, more than doubling the price you pay. Harman's number is 877-871-6755, save yourself a bunch of money, ring them up. I will post another review once I have installed the remote, just wanted to get this out there.",15624.0

When you first turn the device on it is in a language other than english. You will spend a considerable amount of time trying to figure out not only how to get into the settings menu, but once you're there trying to figure out what says \\""language\\"" and then figure out how to change it to english. The menu also locks and won't let you access it depending on whether the device is recording or not.<br />2. The manual is poorly translated and most things it talks about aren't actually configurable in the menu. Most configurable options you will have to figure out what they mean yourself. Trial and error.<br />3. Video quality is very good, audio recording is fine.<br />4. GPS data appears to be inaccurate. The included software did show my track on google maps, but was off probably 20 miles or so. Speed data works good and displays in the video.<br />5. The device will behave differently depending upon whether or not it is plugged in and whether or not you are using usb or the included car charger. If plugged into usb you are present a menu which doesn't really make sense. \\""MSC\\"", \\""Charge\\"", \\""Open\\"". From what I gather select \\""MSC\\"" to make the device appear as a storage device on your PC, select \\""Charge\\"" to simply charge the device via usb, and select \\""open\\"" to open the recorder function. When plugged into the car charger the device will automatically power up when power is supplied and start recording. This works well and will stop recording and turn off when power is turned off to the device. According to the manual this is configurable but it doesn't actually seem to be.<br />6. Tested recording this morning on way to work. I configured the device to record at full resolution and \\""recycle\\"" the recordings every 512MB. This didn't seem to work very well. Some recordings were close to 512MB but others were much smaller, and I had gaps of about 30 seconds in between the videos when nothing was recorded. I will turn off recycling which should fix the gaps but will make forvery large recordings (file sizes).<br />7. Has a battery which is good but no idea how long it would last recording.<br />8. Fix the gaps between the videos when it doesn't record and fix the GPS and I will deal with having to figure out everything else myself and give it 4 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: The camera is totally unreliable and inconsistent. You will have no confidence that it will record when it is supposed to. This morning it just quit recording half way to work for no reason. I think I want my money back now.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: Tried a new class 10 micro sd card this morning. Seems to work a little better but still was one time where it skipped 10 seconds in between clips. Looks like it may skip time in recording when the gps becomes active and start writing it's log. Anyway, the gps is still off so I will try disabling gps altogether and see if that helps.<br /><br />A lady backed into me in a parking lot today going to lunch and I missed it because the stupid sd card was in my laptop because I was trying to figure out how much time it skipped on my way into work.

One night I was playing beer pong with some friends and we didn't have speakers, so I thought it would be great to have this so we could turn a cup or trash can into a speaker.  I ordered it the next day with high hopes.  Once I got it I did what anyone else would do and started testing objects to see what things this sounds good on.  After the initial WOW factor of seeing how this thing turns almost anything into a speaker I realized several flaws.  Most importantly the sound quality on almost anything you attach it to is pretty terrible and the volume it produces is rather unimpressive.  Even on large boxes and many things they suggest to attach it to, it just never gets as loud as I would like, the bass barely comes through, and it has a muffled sound.  Many objects don't even get louder than just my phone speaker which sucks.  On top of that within the first day of use the sticky pad kept falling off objects no matter how many times I cleaned it or changed it.  The winding mechanism for the vibrating pad always gets caught no matter how I wind it and is extremely frustrating.  For the first two days I thought the length of the cord was only a couple inches until I finally yanked on it hard enough only to discover several more inches, and even after that it still got caught and was difficult to unwind.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend the Rock-It 3.0 to anyone.  Sure, when you first get it you will be impressed by the technology involved and how it can turn almost anything into a speaker, and your friends will be impressed initially as well, but once the novelty wears off you realize there are way better portable speakers out there.  Having a portable speaker is great so I recommend any of the portable speakers they sell on Amazon for even cheaper than this.  Many have hundreds of positive reviews. When it comes down to it you want to buy this product to have a portable speaker and why mess around with finding boxes or other objects, sticky pads that fall off, poor sound quality and volume, and a frustrating winding mechanism when you can buy a cheaper rechargeable portable speaker that has better sound quality and volume, fits in your pocket, and doesn't have any of the negatives involved with the Rock-It.  Don't waste your money.  Buy a different portable speaker and you will not regret it.",15562.0

I synced the player, and the vast majority of my music would not play. I formatted it and tried again with the same results. I went through all my 800 files and made sure they were MP3s. They still would not play. After hours of trying to find the problem, I called costumer service. I compared a file that played and a file that did not and we found no difference. After a week, the company emailed me with a link to a file converter which was not free, expecting me to buy membership and manually convert all 800 files again.

Unfortunately, this is not really a positive purchase. I can honestly say I am pretty disappointed in Pioneer and this head unit. I am hoping Pioneer gets these issues straightened out and fixed with a firmware update.<br /><br />First, the positive:<br />-This unit really sounded much better than my previous Pioneer Premier F90BT. There was a notable clarity once I switched to it.<br />-I can connect two ipods to it rather than just one.<br />-The G.U.I. was also very appealing.<br />-Not having a bunch of harnesses in the back of the unit was also a plus and made installation a lot easier.<br />-Most of the issues with the head unit appear to be software based, and hopefully will be fixed soon<br />-The screen has a very vivid and clear resolution. It is definitely one of the nicer screens I have seen.<br />-Very quick load up time. Unit is ready to go in seconds from turning the car on.<br /><br />The Negative:<br />-The screen goes dead and does not respond to any touches intermittently.  Considering so many features are controlled by touching the screen, this is a bad deal.<br />-If you're using an iphone, the iphone alert sound effects come though when listening to Pandora or the ipod feature from the iphone.  Im not sure if it's a head unit issue or a iphone issue, but when driving to music this is annoying.<br />-The GPS apps are garbage. PERIOD.<br />-If you connect the iphone before the Bluetooth connects, it causes all sorts of problems. The Pandora feature does not work, you have to use AppRadio in order to hear Pandora, but AppRadio will also not function properly. If you turn off your car for any reason, you have to disconnect the iphone when you restart it, if the Bluetooth connects while the iphone is already connected to the head unit, then you will have the above mentioned problems.<br />-The CD-IU201S Cable is ridiculously too short. The part of the cable that connects to the iphone is sadly only 2 feetlong, which means you have to mount the iphone very close to the unit. I bought an Iphone extension and it caused AppRadio to no longer function. Ridiculous.<br />-My ipod locks up at least 6-10 times a week with this head unit. When I check the ipod after i have disconnected it, it still has the pioneer logo on it and in order for it to get working again i have to do a restart.<br />-This unit produces an insane amount of noise (hissing). Its audible when listening to music or if the unit is on with nothing selected as a source.<br /><br />ALSO!!! Pioneer is aware of the issues with this unit, but has no intention of releasing a firmware update to fix it. Basically, you are on your own. This unit will not be brought to a better standard and it is what it is, unlike the pioneer units in the past which recieved firmware updates to fix problems and issues.<br /><br />Im really saddened by this unit. I have been a loyal pioneer customer for many years. I have gone through 8 Units and this is terrible. I wanted to replace my F90BT with something newer and faster, with a more precise GPS. I originally was considering the AVIC-Z140BH, but I really didn't like that I would have to disconnect my ipod and connect my iphone to use certain features. I am accustomed to connecting my ipod, which has all my music on it, to the head unit and putting it in the glove box and not messing with it anymore. I was hoping for the same with the iphone apps but this is not the car. You have to use the iphone itself to control the iphone apps, with the exception of Pandora. This is dangerous as you have to keep taking your eyes off the road to do this, not to mention the clumsy short cable causing problems with reach.<br /><br />I will say that as just a head unit its great. the major downside to it is the iphone/ipod controls in appmode. also the whole having to wait till bluetooth connects is also annoying. if you do it wrong you have to turn off the car and try again.<br /><br />UPDATE -I am no longer able to find much positive in this purchase. Last night while driving the unit began having volume issues when connected to an iPhone. It also had issues with the iPhone playing music OVER the ipod that was selected. Even after pressing mute the issue was not resolved, as the music continued to play blaring. I am no longer partially satisfied with my purchase and am now considering purchasing another one and getting rid of this one. It has not been helpful.",15557.0

It worked great for the first 12 months but soon after it acted a little weird on one trip. Upon my return I found it had only transmited for half the trip, even though it appeared to be working the entire time. After that I was unable to get the device to transmit anything ever again. I called SPOT and their customer service told me that there must have been some electronics failure internally and since it was beyond the warranty period by 1 month I would have to go buy a new one. After getting a new one I spent a lot of time working with SPOT to finally get that one linked to my account. Again this one worked well for just over a year. Now this one is doing the exact same thing. I turned it on for a trip and it transmitted my first location, then has not transmitted or been able to get a GPS fix since. Since it can't get a GPS fix it won't even try to send the SOS message. The worst part again is that for the trip the device never showed any red lights indicating an error. I wonder if I had pressed the 911 button if it would have let me believe help was on the way. SPOT once again refuses to rectify the problem. I have not abused the device in any way, I always carry it in the top pouch of my backpack on trips shielded from water (even though it claims to be waterproof).

It worked great powering 120v xmas lights and recharging cell phones.<br /><br />I followed the instructions and charged the battery every couple months to maintain the charge.  A few months ago, the battery stopped holding a charge.  I would charge it to 100%, and after unplugging it, the charge would go to 60% in 15 minutes.  I checked the manual and noted that the battery was outside the 6 month warranty period.  I called Goal Zero and the rep told me that the batteries now had 12 month warranties, which was a nice surprise.  The rep agreed to send me a new unit with a return shipping label.  It took about 4 weeks to get the replacement, which seems to be working fine over the last couple months.  I keep this unit plugged in all the time, hoping that it won't have the same issues as my first battery.  The manual indicates the battery should have a 5 year life span if maintained properly. Time will tell...<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, the inverter does seem very cheaply made and doesn't connect to the battery very securely.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would recommend buying this unit, especially for the price.  I think Goal Zero has some bugs it needs to workout before it can justify such a high price tag.<br /><br />****Updated 10/25/12<br />The replacement battery will not hold a charge above 12.4 to 12.5 volts, which is roughly 70-80% discharged for most 12v batteries.  I have charged the battery every week since I received it and have not abused it in any way.  I have used it to charge some batteries on and off using the 12v cigarette adapter.  I also let it run down to 50% and then recharged to see if it would get above 12.5 volts.  No luck.  There is no explanation for why such an expensive battery would perform so poorly.<br /><br />I agree 100% with another reviewer who said the high price must be for the fancy packaging.  You would be muchbetter served creating your own power back-up system without relying on the Goal Zero proprietary cables & plugs.<br /><br />I bought a couple Trojan 24-TMX batteries for $135/each and a NOCO genius charger.

Firstly when you receive your item that comes the size of an old school casset tape (shocked me from the photos they put on the advertisement), you will notice how cheaply it is built and can tell right there this is not a product designed to last or stand the test of use.  This product is supposed to work at distances of 300 feet from the IR blaster...  It doesn't work from 15 feet away...  I bought this so that I could sit on my back porch and control my Direct TV and listen to various ball games or shows that I like to hear while outside.  If I am sitting in direct site of the IR Blaster I can use my ipad and it works about 75% of the time.

It is small, lightweight, stylish and comes with a small battery charger. I went to an AT&T Store to get a SMS card for it, which has a unique phone number. I bought a plan for text-messaging-only (no voice) that cost $10 for 30 days so I could try it out.  I can get 1 year of service for $100.  The unit's instructions were not translated into English very well, but they were adequate if used step-by-step.<br /><br />While initially setting up the unit, the indicator light did not blink to show that it was receiving GSM/GPS signals!  I took out the SIM card and put it back together a couple of times.  The metal plate (foil) that holds down the SIM card is tricky and had to be slid in pretty hard down its track to get it into place. Finally, it started blinking.<br /><br />Initializing the unit and changing the default password was easy by sending it text messages from my cell phone and then waiting for its quick text reply. As described in the instructions, making 10 phone calls to the unit made my cell phone the administrator.  Allowing another cell phone to contact the unit also went well.<br /><br />If the unit is sent a cell phone call, a recorded voice will answer, and then it sends you back a text message with a web address to find the unit's location on Goggle map.  On my iPhone I could just tap the address, and the correct location and address were rapidly displayed on a street map.  Sometimes it was necessary to call it twice to be sure I got an updated location.<br /><br />Other features that I did not explore were voice surveillance, geo-fence, movement alert, overspeed alert nor the SOS button.  The unit works on the cell phone text messaging system (SMS) by default, but it can be changed to the GPRS data system for web-based tracking.  PC software and instructions for web-based tracking were included ona 3 inch CD, but I did not try this out.<br /><br />Overall, the unit does exactly what I wanted it to do and fairly inexpensively.  I keep it in my Mercedes, so if ever stolen I'll know its location.  Other family members drive my car, too, so I can always find their location if needed.  I have a dog that occasionally strays far from our yard, so putting it on his collar would let me quickly know where to find him.",15465.0

Maybe at one time this was a decent kit for the money, but sure as hell isn't anymore. It's so lousy in fact that I'm giving it away except for the terminals and fuse holder which are of average quality and sufficient. It is NOT pure copper, it's copper clad aluminum. The insulation makes up half of the diameter- it is not true 4 gauge...put it this way, if I hold up a pencil eraser next to the power wire(meaning the actual center copper core), the eraser covers it up and then some...I had a small section of Knu Konceptz 4 GA wire sitting around left over from a previous install and compared it to this XXX garbage. No joke, the Knu wire's core is double the thickness off XXX-the Knu wire held up to a pencil: add about an 1/8\\"" of wire extra surrounding the whole eraser. The only reason I didn't buy from them again is because they were out of stock...but that's where I'm goin again, it's well worth the few day wait. The RCA's in the XXX kit suck out loud too. Thin as all getout, look and feel extremely flimsy, with hardly any insulation around them- which can leave you with a terrible signal and noise through your amp. The only justification for this kit would be if you were on an extremely limited budget and hooking something cheap up-that's less than 500 watts, and even then I'd be worried. Seriously, check out KnuKoncepz.com on a google search, it'll take you to their store...you can get copperclad true 4ga wire with decent RCA's, fuse holder, terminals, grommets (this kit had none or speaker wire) plus I think 10ft of good 16g speaker cable for only $6 more. Or they have excellent true copper kits starting at around $50. I don't do this for a living, but I've hooked up well over 10 systems over the past 15 years, and I can tell you that this isn't the way to go. Spend just a few bucks more and your stereo and ears will thank you for it.<br /><br />UPDATE: someone was nice enough to post a picture of different brands' wires up in the top left of the page. Click on it, you'll easily see what a huge difference there really is in one brand's wire thickness compared to the next- and this XXX  is one of the worst out of the bunch.

I needed it for critical cell phone battery backup charge when I have to visit remote locations for one day at a time and times when I take my elderly parent to the hospital all day. It worked every time. Unfortunately, this January 2012, this battery will not charge. It has died. The cord with attached power supply box work (green led lights up), but the actual battery itself does not light up and does not accept a charge. I tried playing around, checking and rechecking connections without success.  Good luck if your New Trent lasts more than a year.",15404.0

No argument there.  However, my first call to Square Trade resulted in \\""of course you have a manufacturer's warranty\\"".  Not so, this was sold in conjunction with an Amazon Warehouse transaction, USED, there was no guarantee of a manufacturer's warranty, clearly stated on the item description.  Thus I purchased this warranty as it was offered in conjunction with this item - USED item (note it was a reduced price as well as being sold in conjunction with the item).  Square Trade informed me that they would not cover if USED, had to be new or refurb.  They had no offering in conjunction with Amazon that was to be utilized for USED items.  OK, try again, maybe just not well informed rep.  Next call, nope, not covered, must be new or refurb.  For that matter not covered until 61 days.  Huh - the blurb in the ad for this Square Trade Warranty sold in conjunction with Amazon Warehouse item coverage starts from day one.  There is a spot where one can pull up the additional details, yep - 61 days, must be NEW or REFURB.  Huh, not what the initial and surface reading on the ad referenced, appeared to be a special offering to protect the consumer specifically for the USED item sold in the Amazon Warehouse transaction from day 1, due to no manufacturer's warranty available (USED item).  For those that wonder, I have read it all, in its entirety multiple times....not having hallucinations.....  OK, try again, this time even more interesting - 41 days until covered.....I give.....the speaker was blown in the item, was within the 30 day Amazon return frame, as much as I want the item, it is being returned.  I will purchase NEW with a manufacturer's warranty.  Will purchase from Amazon, I suspect that this is not the fault of Amazon, just a sneaking suspicion that Amazon is under the same impression that I am, coverage for USED and starts from day 1 (due to no manufacturer's warranty available).  Suggestion to the parties involved...get your story straight....either this offering IS or IS NOT applicable to provide warranty coverage of a USED item sold by Amazon Warehouse Deals....AND....coverage starts from day 1....41....or 61, take your pick, but inform accurately.  Edit:  Just went to the item (Square Trade) page for reference to this posting....chuckle, now changed to day 31....sorry guys I printed the original page that was offered in conjunction with the item.....yep it sez DAY 1.....please figure it out, get it straight, and get on the same line.  Day 31 actually makes sense as Amazon return policy allows 30 days....however, the initial offering was misleading, now for future reference get the item disposition straight - it is USED, not new or refurb, open box infers NEW or REFURB.",15379.0

I also avoid reviewing specific sellers (Seller1On1, in this case) in product reviews.

I couldn't get the FM mode to activate (the FM LED indicator never illuminated, so it wasn't just a non-working speaker issue). Pressing the FM button to change frequencies should have caused the Jabra to announce the new frequency, but it didn't. Pressing the call button brought up the appropriate voice dial function on the BB & Nexus, but any phone calls I made (dialed from the handset) didn't play, nor did Pandora or streaming radio.<br /><br />\\""Okay,\\"" I figured, \\""a defective unit, send it back and get a replacement, no problem.\\""<br /><br />But since I already had a second unit with this order, I unpacked it. The first thing I noticed: it was packed differently. No separate baggies for the charger and USB cord, like how the first one was packed. Then I powered it up, and had another \\""non-working speaker\\"" problem. So I broke down and read over the instructions...<br /><br />Interestingly, upon its initial power up, each speakerphone is supposed to automatically enter pairing mode -- indicated by a voice announcement accompanied by a rapidly flashing blue LED.

The PMP120-4 is a great example on how former big brands are used to sell electronics which are made straight for the landfill.  Even though this device is a piece of junk, there is one thing which surprised me positively: I was able to manage the music using my Linux Netbook. Ubuntu recognized the player instantly and I was able to Upload and play my mp3 files using Banshee. Great! - But that's about it.  The aluminum looks nice and appears to be solid. However, the clip and the screen do not.  Peeling off the screen sticker reveals a not centered LCD screen, which makes the player look even cheaper than it is. The screen does not have brilliant colors either: Everything looks washed out. But you can live with that if you are not picky and use the player only to play your music.  The biggest problem with this device is the confusing navigation and the unresponsive touch screen.  This the fourth MP3 player I bought so far, but it is the first one, where you need the handbook to figure out how to change the volume! Even though the player has four buttons on the top, none of these are to control the volume instantly. - You have to swipe down on the screen to access the another screen to access volume control. There you can use the buttons on the device as well as two graphic buttons on the screen. - Ridiculous! - And even worse, the screen does not respond instantly or in the wrong way. - Getting out of the volume screen is a guessing game, like the rest of the navigation.  I also did not find a way to fast forward or rewind. May be it is in the handbook, but who cares? I will return the device anyways. I expect from a music player, that I have buttons to control the volume directly.  By the way, I tried out the voice recorder, also. I got my voice recorded with it. I do not know how I did it, without any visual clues on the screen. I guess I was just lucky.  Pros:  + Works very well under Ubuntu with Banshee  Cons:  - Navigation is not intuitive. It not user friendly at all.   - Touch screen does not always respond  - Flimsy screen (it appears to break any second)   - Bad headphones  - Fit and finish  - Built in battery  - Does sometimes not turn on  My advise: DO NOT BUY IT!",15350.0

The Good:  1. The sound quality is great.  2. The preset radio stations, audio in, and iPod/iPhone plug works great and, like I said, produces great audio.  3. The display is nice and offers many different levels of dimming.  4. Battery backup is nice.  5. The ability to sync time with your iPhone is cool too.   The Bad:  1. The \\""app\\"" that they sell to \\""enhance\\"" it doesn't work. Just look on the app store. 1 Star rating and many negative reviews.  2. If you set the volume low for \\""sleep\\"" mode, that is the volume that it uses to wake you up in the morning (when the alarm works...see \\""the ugly\\"")! So basically, you are supposed to wake up to the same level of sound that you were able to fall asleep too. Yeah...that's a great idea. The app \\""enhancement\\"" can fix this, but like I said, the app itself doesn't work.   3. If you decide that you want to use the sleep feature but want something else beside music to wake you up, there is a \\""buzzer\\"" feature. Well, the \\""buzzer\\"" sounds more like an alarm on a children's wrist watch...just a little beep-beep-beep. Good luck waking up to that.  The Ugly:  1. The alarm is intermittent in all wake up modes....AM/FM, line in, \\""buzzer\\"", iPod. It simply doesn't work sometimes. I've tried many different variables for a week and haven't figured out what makes it work and what doesn't.  2. If your device has a \\""sleep\\"" mode or the screen times out after a certain amount of time (like, oh 6-8 hours of sleeping), then so does the audio. IF YOUR ALARM IS SET TO WAKE TO AUDIO, IT WILL NOT SOUND! The only way to avoid this is to have your screen stay on all the time, stare at the bright light from the screen at night, then change the settings in the AM so your battery isn't killed during the day. Very inefficient.  The Bottom line is that if you want a cheap speaker set for your device that also produces great sound, this is great. However, be warned that if you are looking for analarm clock, LOOK ELSEWHERE!",15344.0

Therefore, the phone determines it is only capable of a 500 mA charge current such as when connected to a computer USB port.

I finally decided to upgrade my aging IVA-d300 for a full double din, and I am really bummed with how badly designed everything is. I wonder if they had anybody try this thing out at the factory before selling them. I have a background in QA, and in the first 24 hours of using this unit, I found about 10 inexcusable bugs in the system. I'll go down the list for you.<br /><br />1. Bluetooth calling is completely useless. I can hear people ok, but they can't hear me at all. They say it sounds like I'm in a wind tunnel when I'm sitting still and the car is idling. It is UNUSABLE. And I have tried several different mic mounting locations. No luck.<br /><br />2. The unit doesn't remember ANYTHING. I start a movie from my iPod, get halfway through, and turn the car off. I turn it back on, I have to start the movie over from the beginning. And there is no quick way to jump to later in the video. Just basic 4x fastforward. Worthless.<br /><br />2b. Select an album from ipod, listen for a while. Turn car off. Turn car back on, now I can't quickly change albums or artists. I have to start a new search.<br /><br />2c. None of the phone history is saved after power off, nor is it updated on power up. But this doesn't really matter since the bluetooth is useless anyways. But if it DID work, this would be very frustrating.<br /><br />3. Deck displays Error03 every couple of days requiring me to pull over, and unplug my iPod and reconnect it.<br /><br />4. Deck sometimes completely locks up my iPod requiring a hard restart of the iPod.<br /><br />5. After using this deck for less than 4 months, it is suddenly starting to just power off for no apparent reason while driving. Sometimes it turns itself back on after a few seconds, and sometimes I have to turn it on. I'm sure it's not an external wiring issue as I've gone through every wire in the system 10 times over.<br /><br />6. I'm using an AudysseyImprint because I was hoping it would take the guesswork out of tuning the system. Well I ran the program several times, and it sounds like garbage. The only benefit is it gives me the EQ options that the deck should have come with from the factory. So I just tune it myself. Main issue is that I had to pay $180 for a VERY basic EQ.<br /><br />7. The deck doesn't output Navigation commands through the Imprint. It just mutes the music, and then no voice. Although this may be considered a feature since the navigation's voice is obnoxious.<br /><br />8. Since the maps haven't been updated in YEARS, many businesses you try to search for don't show up at all. Ie. Chase didn't exist as ATMs, so you must search for Washington Mutual instead. This is one of many examples.<br /><br />9. There is apparently a firmware update available for the deck, but there is absolutely no information anywhere on how to put it on the deck. I have the file, now how the hell do I use it Alpine???<br /><br />10. The unit is billed as a \\""Bluetooth included\\"" deck, but what they don't tell you is that the bluetooth is a separate device that is huge, needs it's own power source, and needs to be located somewhere in the tiny space behind your deck. Also, it doesn't work.<br /><br />I'm sure there are other issues with the deck that I'm forgetting right now, but these are my biggest complaints. Alpine has lost my business permanently with this joke of a unit.<br /><br />**Edit**<br />So I've had this piece of crap installed for over a year now, and I hate it more than than when I bought it.<br /><br />I forgot to mention that the Bluetooth doesn't actually pass audio (specifically music) even though everything on the product's site page says it will, as well as all the documentation I've seen. Well come to find out (I just happened to stumble across a youtube video explaining this) the included Bluetooth unit doesn't support audio. Again: THE INCLUDED BLUETOOTH DOES NOT SUPPORT AUDIO.  Even though their f'ing website clearly states it does. So being the idiot I am, I shelled out another $110 for the \\""upgraded\\"" Bluetooth unit. Now I have audio. It sounds terrible, but there it is. Hurray.<br /><br />Additionally, these SOBs want $100 just to update the maps in the deck.<br /><br />Lastly, there is no way to actually get any help from Alpine. Their e-mail form clearly states they will not contact you back, and a phone call usually ends in a message.<br /><br />STAY AWAY.",15309.0

They are outstanding! (I rate them higher than 5 stars). I was not happy with the anti-glare verson of this screen saver because it slightly distorted the text.  I also had installation problems.  Amazon immediately replaced my anti-glare screen saver with the clear version. Amazon has now posted step-by-step instructions and a video on the product page that walks you through the installation process. I found these instructions to be very helpful.  I really like the clear screen saver. Once you have it installed you don't even notice that its there.  It doesn't diminish the beautiful clarity of the Kindle Fire screen in any way. It does the job - protects the Kindle's glass screen without any distortion.  Installing it took a little time.  I suggest that you read the instructions on the product page and watch the video. Be sure to clean the screen well before installing.  Most importantly - make sure there is no dust on the screen because even a small particle of dust will cause an air bubble. The screen protector is cut to fit perfectly so take your time aligning it (I had to fiddle with this a little).  Once its on correctly, work any air bubbles out using the little plastic tool included with the kit.  They do give you an extra screen protector in the package in case you mess up and get dust under the protector (which can be almost impossible to get rid of).  Some other reviewers mention that the plastic tool included in the kit scratched the screen protector.  I did not experience this.  I removed the thin plastic film on the outside surface of the screen protector AFTER I worked out the air bubbles. Then I carefully removed the thin plastic outer film.  Removing this film did lift the screen protector in a few places, so I had a few more airbubbles to work out.  I used a lens cleaning cloth first to try to work out these bubbles, then used the plastic tool on the few remaining bubbles.  I got rid of the bubbles and didn't get any scratchs.   If you are looking for something to protect the screen of your Kindle Fire without diminishing the its clarity, I recommend this clear screen protector. [[ASIN:B005HSG41Y Kindle Fire Clear Screen Protector 2-Pack with Cleaning Cloth by Marware - Lifetime Warranty]]  ------------------------------------------------------------------  ORIGINAL REVIEW below  ------------------------------------------------------------------  I got this to protect the screen on my new Kindle Fire and am very disappointed with it.  First off, I thought the installation instructions were hard to understand (for me, anyway).  It was very difficult to line up correctly to fit the screen.  If it is off even slightly you get air bubbles around the edges which won't seal. I never did get all of the air bubbles out. If they had made it even slightly smaller I think this problem would have been avoided. The worse thing about this screen protector is that it distorts the text, making it slightly blurry.  I use my Kindle primarily for reading (this is my 3rd Kindle). I haven't read much since installing this screen protector - but I think this distortion is going to be a major issue. My guess is that this screen protector going to end up in the trash very soon.  I kind of feel like I just wasted $15.",15296.0

Two screen protectors and a cleaning cloth come in the package.  The instructions state to remove all the dirt and dust particles from the screen with the cleaning cloth provided.  I first carefully cleaned the screen with a lint-free eyeglass wipe and then wiped the screen down with the supplied cleaning cloth.  After carefully applying the film to the screen, I noticed small flecks of something under the film that were causing bubbles that I could not remove.  I pulled the first film off the screen, repeated the cleaning process and applied the second screen protector to the screen with exactly the same results. Upon further examination of the small flecks, they appear to be small threads that I suspect came from the cleaning cloth.  The scalloped edges of the cleaning cloth fray and leave tiny threads on the screen.    I recommend that you DO NOT use the supplied cleaning cloth before applying this protector.  This was a waste of time, effort and money.  Can I get a refund?",15296.0

This product, by far, has been the worst screen protector I've used yet.<br /><br />Installation went flawlessly as these types of protectors go.  Clean surface, keep dust away, use squeegee, and perfect install.  When I peeled off the top protective layer to reveal the protector's surface, however, it all went down hill.<br /><br />It has a matte-type feel to the surface.  It's not a pure, clear film.  At first, I thought this might reduce reflections or fingerprints, but this is simply not the case.  It picks up fingerprints quite a bit (enough to be distracting), and glares show up quite a bit.  If this was the only issue, it wouldn't be quite bad.  I mean, it kinda feels nicer to the touch (fingers glide a lot more smoothly) than on a bare screen, personally.<br /><br />However, the worst part is that when I turned my Kindle on, I realized it was the kind of protector that rainbows.  If you've used a variety of screen protectors in the past, you may know what this means.  It especially stands out when the screen is white.  Instead of a clean white background, you see traces of reds, greens, blues (yes - all the colors that make up white) instead. As other reviewers point out, this makes it incredibly difficult to read text, and some images look down-right awful.<br /><br />I thought I couldn't go wrong with a peel type - they're usually better than wet-install types (they usually are terrible with the \\""orange peel\\"" effects), but I most certainly didn't expect something of this grade at this price.  I want to take the film off as soon as I finish writing this review, but will leave it on for 24 hours just to make sure the rainbow effect is really here to stay (some protectors improve on this after 24-48 hours, so I'll update my review if this is the case).  But as it stands, it's simply a disgrace to the nice display that our Kindles have.  There most definitely will be much better screen protectors as more vendors start targeting the Kindle.

I normally don't spend this much on a protector, but it was the only one I found when I pre-ordered the Kindle.  I wish I had waited.  It arrived three days after my Kindle did, part Amazon's fault and part UPS' fault.  I had almost gotten used to using the Fire with just the glass, since I have a case on it (Marware's leather case actually).  I sat down to put the protector on, wiped the screen with the included cloth, and started applying it.  I kept noticing a whole bunch of particles getting on it, but went ahead with the placement.  After it was on and smoothed out, I kept noticing it was attracting tiny fibers.  I was watching a movie, and saw that there were a cluster of them in one side.  I kept brushing at it, until I finally realized they were UNDER the protector.  No bubbles, just a whole group of fibers.  I tried lifting the protector off in that area (not an easy feat, even though it's not sticky per se), and used tape to take the fibers off. However, when I tried smoothing it out again it wouldn't smooth down; it was now bumping up where I had apparently bent the protector when I tried to lift it (other protectors allow you to lift it with tape, not so with this one).  I also had a VERY hard time taking the backing off the top of the protector once it was on the Fire; it kept taking the whole thing off.  I finally got so annoyed I took that one off and started over with the second protector (it's garbage now, with the dent it won't stay).  This time I used a compressed air duster as I was smoothing the protector on the screen (not an easy feat with just two hands).  I basically smoothed down the protector with my arm (which surprisingly worked quite well).  I then went in and smoothed out the bubbles with a credit card.  I did use a different cloth (not the one that came with it) and found there were fewer fibers floating around.  There was still an edge that had some fibers (I am a bit OCD with any flaws on my gadget screens) so I lifted the corner and used tape to remove those fibers.  Of course now that edge doesn't go down all the way, and has a little bubble near the corner, but I give up with it.  It does take some of the glare away, but also makes the screen somewhat difficult to view.  The icons looked very pixelated (WTF???) and I wondered if there was something wrong with the Fire until I realized it was the protector.  I can see videos okay, but I think they were close to HD before and are now just passable.  I'm still undecided as to whether I will keep this expensive piece of junk on the Fire.  I did notice the graph lines that another reviewer mentioned, and it does get annoying at times.  All in all, a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.  I may at some point just toss this one as well, and stick with the nothing on the Fire.

That's the main feature of this device.  I was also swayed by the customer reviews praising the Gomadic Company and its customer service.  I can verify that Gomadic's customer service is outstanding:  Every complaint I had was graciously answered within one business day, and a new device was mailed to me immediately at no charge, no questions asked.  But no company can make a business around great customer service alone.  The product also needs to work more or less as advertised.  And this one does not.  The first device I received would transmit as long as I didn't plug in the second cable to allow simultaneous charging.  As soon as I attempted to charge, the audio no longer appeared in the FM signal.  In other words, it basically never worked as advertised.  Gomadic's CSR emailed me that it's a \\""recently discovered\\"" \\""bug with the device\\"", but they have \\""resolved the issue\\"" and are sending me a new device.  Well, the new device actually worked ... for about three weeks.  Then, unfortunately, it started transmitting all kinds of nasty noises, regardless of whether the Sansa Clip was plugged into it, or turned on, or charging.  Therefore, this device became unusable as an FM transmitter.  The Gomadic CSR apologized and sent me a third device.  This one performed exactly like the first one.  That is, it never allowed transmitting and charging at the same time.  Ordinarily, I'd apply the three-strikes-and-you're-out rule.  But because of the responsive customer service, and because I really wanted this device to work, I decided to give Gomadic one last chance.  My last email to them reviewed my experience, and stated that I planned to write an Amazon customer review based on whether they could make good on their product's main claim - to transmit and charge at the same time.  The CSR apologized again, stating, \\""We have sent a new one today which we are certain will resolve these issues.\\""  It was not to be.  The fourth device performed exactly like the first and third.  So now I have four devices, none of which work as advertised. All but the second never worked as advertised.  The second only worked for three weeks. The three dead-on-arrival units are manufactured with a 5/32\\"" round cable, while the one which worked briefly has a flat twin zip-cord style cable.  I suspect that the units with flat cable also contain an internal bug fix allowing the unit to work correctly initially ... until something else goes wrong.  Units with round cable will probably never work as advertised.  It is unacceptable to me that the main feature does not work as advertised, so I gave it one star.  Apparently others feel differently.  Two previous customer reviews note that this feature does not work, but they gave it three and even four stars anyway.",15290.0

When jammed all the way in, two of the bottom buttons are half obscured, and the entire top of the screen is obscured (including the entire notifications bar) Not only is the clear window not nearly tall enough, but it isnt even as -wide- as the bionic's screen.

For a portable battery pack I expect much better resilience.  I was also unhappy with the coiled USB cord that is included.  By it's nature it will be unable to extend to its full length and stay there.  The tendency will be to retract potentially pulling the pack off a flat surface, possibly leading to damage in the internal power connector.  A standard cord would be easier (and safer) to use.

Needless to say, looks can be deceiving. I Very rarely post reviews, but I think this had to be said.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good dash cam, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Out of the box it works, as long as you have a MicroSD card. I noticed that it didn't come with one before ordering, so I bought myself a 16GB class 10. I figured the best, to match the camera's specs. I had the camera set to record for 1 minute (you can have longer), but reading from the manual, the longer the clips, the longer the duration between file saves. For a 1 minute clip, you have to wait 3 seconds between clips. 3 seconds is unbelievably slow for a class 10 MicroSD card! That wasn't even the part that bothered me the most. I've got the camera late in the day, and by the time I had a quick rundown of the manual I was itching to take it for a test run. The sun had set and this is where the night mode came into play. Keep in mind I also own a generic \\""HD DVR\\"" that I bought from dealextreme (hey, even that came with a flip-down screen, standard SD card slot, 120 degree lens, and about $125 cheaper)! I put these two side by side for a night comparison shot. I drove for about an hour, just to make sure that they both captured something worth saving. When I got home to check the footage I came into another problem. As for the generic \\""HD DVR\\"" all I have to do is unplug it, spin it 360 degrees or so and it falls into my hand, ready for me to bring inside, not so much with the GS600. For that I have to hold one of the sides, and in a meticulous manner, unscrew the other side (which means I'm using both hands, hoping not to adjust my rear view mirror while unscrewing)! From there, I can bring both of them inside and view the footage. Now onto editing: I own a Mac and for whatever reason, the files from the GS600 will not preview, I have to open them with Quicktime and view them there. It's not too much of a hassle, but the generic \\""HD DVR\\"" can easily preview. Viewing the files I can honestly say for the price of the GS600, the quality of night shots are abysmal, even worse compared to my other dash cam. I let myself rest on it over the night, hoping that morning shots would be better. After about noon I  did some morning shots, unmounted the whole unit (suction cup included) and viewed the footage. Not bad, but again, not better than my other dash cam. The GPS took way too long to activate and find a signal, even when starting from different points in my town. It took on average, about a minute to start showing the blue light indicating GPS signal. For the fun of it, I tried getting into the camera settings (to set it to MPH, and set the clock). I realized that in the package was no AC home adapter, so I managed to find an old TV, and dragged it to my car, hooked up the yellow and white cables and tried to use the remote. The remote is horrible, you basically have to hold it an inch away from the front of the device for it to register. I'll spare you the nitty-gritty of it, but the directions are found in broken English in the manual, so that was a fun hours worth of work &lt;/sarcasm>. Anyway to sum it up, the camera, while small and having a GPS on it, is far from being perfect, and is too overpriced for what it's worth.

Thanks to Amazon, by allowing us to provide user reviews, it's easy to see which ones \\""say they fit\\"" - but don't. This case didn't have a review nor a description. But the photo's looked good and the price was right, so I took the plunge and decided to be the guinea pig for us Apple users. I'll be honest. It looks great in person too. It even fits the Ipod Classic 160gb nicely. The trouble is... it's FULL of MAGNETS. Which of course isn't in the description cause there isn't one! There are 4 button magnets total in the case. Two in the flip door, and two more in the case to match up with those in the door when closed. The two sewn into the case sit nice and tight up against your ipod. This of course is a formula for disaster. Magnets can and will erase hard drives - which this unit has. It might take time due to their small size, but it will eventually happen. You'll see that all the Ipod Classic cases offered on the Apple site (which are outrageously expensive) use VELCRO for closures. I wish this case had too.   I double checked the interior magnets to see if both sides of the button were magnetized by running a metal object down inside the case where the ipod fits - and sure enough it snapped the metal right up. Pretty strong too. Due to this, I don't think it would take long for this case to cause data corruption.  I'm rating this product low - mainly for it's lack of a description, which would have hopefully mentioned the magnetic closure, and of course because it has 4 magnets which surround an electronic device. Someone just wasn't thinking when they built this thing. Too bad. Without the magnets it would have been a 5 star item.",15221.0

Having moved a few times with my many books I quickly saw the benefit in having all of my books in one handy device instead of boxes and instead of going to the awful libraries in California: they are hangouts for bums and rarely have any books I am looking for excepting the main library in traffic jammed downtown. I love this thing though, reading is natural on it.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised when I accidentally put some powerpoint, word documents and .djvu documents on here in that this thing reads them just like any other book file! I am able to just plug this in and have it show up as a drive I can put things on!<br /><br />The touchscreen is the resistor type, instead of the capacitor type which apple uses, so it's not as responsive as your iphone but it does work well. It does take a minute to figure out how the software works but once you do it's smooth sailing.<br /><br />It does not have free wifi/3g included so you have to either have a wifi connection or install the Kobo software on your computer to access the Kobo store and just plug it in and buy books from there. This device is for reading for me, not for browsing the internet or infinite browsing of books so it's not a problem having no internet access.<br /><br />One thing that would be nice is the option to have no page breaks so I don't have to swipe orpress the next page arrow on screen. Just one long continuous scroll would be better. You have to get used to the refresh too when you move the text or go to another page. I would have liked the SD card to be regular size rather than the micro size which I don't have but the included 2GB of space has been enough for me so far. Also autofit to the extents of the screen would be nice, it actually does have this option but it counts the bottom and top menus as edges instead of the actual screen size so the zoom is not enough. Another thing is that it does not remember my zoom setting when going back to a book so I have to rezoom it to where it was after coming back.<br /><br />Overall this is highly recommended, it's a bit higher priced than some e-readers mainly for the touchscreen which works well enough. This thing will read all of the book file types and then some non-book file types as well so if you want flexibility get this.",15213.0

Who would have thought a product made in China, where most patents & copyrights are regularly ignored, would be handicapped by a built-in copyright protector.  I tried to capture my video of my daughter's high school dance group, only to be met with \\""this media is protected by copyright.\\""  It was keying in on the music, and checking it on the internet!!  I had to disable my internet connection to make it work.  What a hassle.         This is probably why the HD QAM tuner locks out all regular over-the-air cable channels.  Yeah, it sees them, but won't let me see them.  Totally useless.  The only way to view DTV is with an antenna.  Forget the included antenna.  The channel scanner takes forever, and the sensitivity sucks.  I spent hours messing with the lousy USB connection on the device (pull it out slightly to make it work), and of course, sometimes it overheats.  Once I did get the capture function working though, it did perform fine, and I captured video from VHS, old camcorder tapes, and even rooftop-antenna-received HD broadcasts.  For the high def, I recommend a fast computer for capture, with a top-of-the-line video board for playback.  Otherwise, the video is jerky on playback.  I wish the capture was something other than .meg2, because the HD video shows jagged edges on moving objects.  I reduced this slightly by converting the video to .mkv.         I bought this because all the slots on my Dell i7 860 were taken. (I run 2 video cards & 4 monitors.)  I need a USB stick to capture video.  Because I can't receive any HD cable channels, I can't use this as a computer-as-DVR input.  Spend a little more money, and go somewhere else.         P.S.:  DUAL VIDEO CARDS:   For those of you who are having trouble setting up 2 video cards (and there seems to be a lot of you), here's the secret:  use 2 of the same kind of cards (either ATI or Nvidia), use 2 cards that are similar in performance, and remove the first card (don't uninstall it) before installing the second.

The interface seems like it was rushed into production to meet some deadline & useability suffered greatly.  The lure is the big screen and the lifetime free map function (in the 9020T-LM) but that's not enough to offset its dismal performance.  The first one I took back to Costco and exchanged it because I thought there's no way this can be the way it's supposed to work.  Sadly, it is.  Though it was a new model when I purchased it in May 2011, the RoadMate 1440 that I bought two years earlier is a much better product, even with its smaller screen.  I used the new 9020 to navigate from Seattle to Denver, stopping at two campgrounds enroute.  For the first camp, Farewell Bend in Oregon, it put me 30 miles wrong.  Bad scene.  I'm towing a camp trailer & trying to get turned around on a narrow road in the middle of nowhere, my wife is starting to freak out and I actually began to hear banjo music.  Fortunately I remembered that I had the older RoadMate 1440 stowed in the camper, dug it out & got straight.  The lifetime maps function takes some effort to get right.  When you connect it to your computer the first time and it asks you if you want to store it, don't click the model number where it says 9020 or you'll never get the free updates.  You have to manually change it to read 9020T-LM, then it will work.  It shouldn't be that way.  Let's see, what else?  The battery life is dismal, and you can't charge it via USB.  It will ONLY charge using the auto cigarette lighter cord.  If your car doesn't have a cig lighter port, you're boned.  The pathetic manual doesn't cover much of anything useful.  And why in the world can I not enter a destination by lat & long?  It will tell you the lat & long of a destination, and also where you are, but you can't go the other way with it.  Stupid.

Under the terms of their warranty, they have the option of sending a new or refurbished unit.  This is definitely not satisfactory, at least as far as my situation is concerned.  It's a little like purchasing a brand new computer, finding out after using it for 19 days that it's defective and having the company send me a used/refurbished computer as a replacement.      However, I did contact the company handling the Borders liquidation and found out that I could return the unit for a refund because it was purchased BEFORE July 22, 2011, and I had the original receipt.     I have made the decision to return the unit because the terms of Kobo's warranty are, IMO, not geared toward the consumer.  Reading the warranty will illustrate this; there are entirely too many variables in the company's favor.    So, lesson learned:  Before purchasing any electronic device, be sure you take the time to read the warranty and do so from the perspective that you might be in the same position.  If the terms seem to lean more to the company's benefit type rather than making sure the customer has a quality product - don't spend your hard-earned money.  And, don't hesitate to contact the company's customer service department before you buy so that you can find out exactly how they handle situations regarding defective equipment.      *****    I'm an avid reader and finally broke down and purchased an ereader.  I went with the Kobo Touch from Borders on July 15, 2011, because the price was reasonable.  I tried it in the store and, while it wasn't a Kindle, it got the job done.  Once I got the hang of the touch screen, I was off and reading.  Okay so far.    About one week after I bought the unit, I turned it on and got the message that there was a problem with the memory and it would need to be reset.  This meant that I would have to activatethe factory reset on the unit which meant that the memory would be wiped and I would have to download all of my books again. A pain, but okay, sometimes these things happen.  A computer is a computer after all.       I had also noticed that the battery life wasn't quite what was advertised.  So, at the end of the day, if I wasn't going to be doing any more reading, I just hooked it up to the charger.  Last night, I had a full charge on the battery, read for three hours, and then today for three hours more when the unit shut down and said that it needed to be recharged. No question, the battery was defective.    Borders is going out of business and is now in receivership, so taking the unit back where I purchased it, returning it and getting a refund wasn't going to be possible.  I spoke with the Borders manager and was told this would have to be handled through Kobo.  Okay, so I contacted customer support at Kobo.  After sending in the logfile as requested, Kobo tech support deemed the unit to be defective.  At that point, I requested either a new unit or a refund and informed them that I had the original purchase receipt and the original box it came in.  I also stated that the unit had not been damaged in any way and that it had been treated very, very gently, and all instructions had been followed to the letter.  This could be documented on their servers and in logfiles since I updated the reader daily.      So, now I'm going round and round with Kobo.  They are telling me that they will send a REFURBISHED unit and cannot guarantee that they will send a NEW unit.  The fact is that I purchased a NEW unit 19 days ago.  They have deemed the unit I have as defective.  The unit I have is still under the original warranty.  The warranty states that Kobo has the option of sending a new or refurbished reader (at their discretion).  I get that and since there is an OPTION under the warranty terms, I want a NEW unit but have stated that I will accept a refurbished unit with the clear understanding that if the refurbished unit turns out to be defective, they will issue a refund.  And, the odyssey continues...    Bottom line:  If you purchased your Kobo from Borders, you are out of luck.  Secondly, I'm not really impressed with the Kobo. Between the battery issue and the memory problem, I'm beginning to think this was not a good idea.  Regarding the warranty issue, I will give the company one more chance to make it right, but I'm not impressed with their follow-through on the warranty or refund policy for Borders' customers, especially in view of the fact that Kobo has stated publicly that they own an 11 percent share of Borders.      If I had a do-over (knowing what I know now) I'd go with either Nook or Kindle.  I may have to do that anyway if Kobo doesn't make this right.         UPDATE:  It's official.  Kobo will not issue a refund if the unit was purchased from Borders.  I have no intention of going round and round with them if the replacement unit has any problems.  So, if one is considering purchasing a Kobo (from Borders or anywhere else) I would recommend that you go with Kindle, Nook or Sony instead.

I did not expect the quality of the sound great but I did expect better than this hissing sound.    The volume buttons are also kind of weird situated behind the ff and rev button.

I will be using my nook as a tablet and text book.  I need a protective case that will prop the nook up in landscape OR portrait mode.    This case only really props up the device in portrait mode.  The landscape mode you have to fold back a corner of the flip over cover and very carefully balance it leaning back on the folded edge that wants to keep unfolding and because the edge is folded on an angle the whole nook tilts so that it is not horizontal, making it even more unstable.  The only clue as to how to do this is the picture of the device on the amazon web site the directions are non-existent.    They send directions that tell you that you should NOT use this cover on your device when charging, because it may cause the device to overheat.  It also comes with directions for a screw on belt clip that apparently is for another device, and some Wrap-M for headphones, which I am also assuming is for another product.

It is better built and will last longer.  I tried the L1 because I liked its smaller profile than the L3, which at double the cost of the L1 seemed a little spendy at the time.  You get what you pay for.  My L1 worked great for about two months of light in-home usage, then it began to be plagued by static, dropped connections, crackling, hum and feedback, etc.  The actual dock connector part of the L1 really suffers in comparison to the L3: the L1 connection is held in my friction only, whereas the L3 actually latches and must be released by pressing latch release buttons located on its sides. After a brief period of very light, in=home usage, the outer cover of the L1 started to come off, exposing the internal circuitry.  Unfortunately, my L1 failed shortly after my window for returning it had closed, so it now serves as a reminder that trying to save money by buying 'economy' versions of items is often a false economy.  UPDATE: FiiO would not stand behind the product. After responding to an initial query and indicating they 'might' be able to help out if the vendor wouldn't accept a return, FiiO completely blew me off.

No magnet, no capacitor.    Mid: Nominal 3\\"" (2.765\\"" vibrating diameter including surround), sealed stamped-steel frame, one-piece cloth-textured paper cone and surround, spray painted silver for the aluminum look. (Because spray paint is an excellent audio material.) Cute little ferro-ceramic magnet about the size of a refridgerator note magnet: 1.25\\"" round by 0.26\\"" thick, (minus the holed center). The entire speaker weighs less than an egg. With 6.8 microfarad capacitor.    Woofer: Nominal 6/5\\"" (5.785 vibrating diameter including surround), vented stamped-steel frame, cloth/plastic cone, foam surround, ferro-ceramic magnet is 2.72\\"" round by 0.475\\"" thick outer dimensions. These speakers are actually kind of cute, almost real, worth keeping for a silly project, like a scale model bass cabinet for a Bootsy Collins doll. They're probably responsible for 99% of what you actually hear.    Other: no crossover; 2\\"" diameter x 2\\"" length port; sprung connectors; very light guage wiring - even for headphones.    Boxes: particle board (chipboard) 1/2\\"" thick, the ends are about 1/2\\"" recessed, so inner volume is slightly less than just 1/2\\"" from outer dimensions. Any possible leaks are filled with glue, but pretty well cut. No dados.    General impressions: Considering their visually obvious free-toy-inside quality, they actually have a good stock sound. The inherent EQ is decent, certainly not bass-heavy thumping, or defined highs, but fairly natural to the input signal with no obvious standing waves. As for power handling I would not dare put 200 watts into them, even if you think 200w peak = 100w program = 50w RMS, they'd probably only survive something around a 20/20 stereo at half volume without cringing. Car speakers? No. Oversized desk speakers in search of a tripath amp? Yes.    (I really only bought them because I was too lazy to mock up my own boxes around this size, and I've since put my own woofer and double-tweeters per into them to test an installation before losing the time and effort to size the finals. The two red speakers really will make a cute 2x6.5 bass cabinet to compliment an H&K BATT amp with the two woofers from this.)",15113.0

When we connected our 85W panel (21V), the green lights show it was charging my battery.     A few days later, my brand new battery died. Upon checking the readout at the regulator's terminals (battery and load), it was 18V. It did not cap the volts to about 13V as it claimed it should to charge the battery. At 18V, it damaged my expensive deep-cycled battery before we realized it. At that point, we also measured the MPPT effect and the voltage was constant at about 18V instead of tracking the sun to vary the voltage throughout the day. Bad or faked unit, worst yet since it damaged our battery.",15099.0

Unfortunately, I was mistaken.    The unit is easily mounted on the camera, and the GPS unit quickly signaled satellite acquisition and Bluetooth communication with the camera.  For two days it actually worked, albeit somewhat intermittently.  I have some accurately tagged photos.  The RT90 camera unit is small and unobtrusive.  The GPS unit is also small and easily positioned in a pocket, in the included belt pouch, or on the camera strap.  I was pretty happy at first.      I soon noticed that tagging was intermittent, and after two days the PhotoTrackr seldom functioned.  The GPS unit continued to indicate satellite acquisition and Bluetooth communication with the helpful LED's, but the camera received no information.  I called Gisteq product support and talked at length with the technicians, and finally they replaced the \\""defective\\"" unit with a brand new one.      Once again, the new unit failed 95% of the time to geotag photos.  I verified correct procedures and setting with tech support, and in my own very persistent fashion I tried every other possible combination of camera settings and start-up sequence, but never was able to improve performance.    The PhotoTrackr is a brilliant idea, and may someday work after thorough re-engineering.  To me it is clear that there is a fundamental design flaw, erroneous software communication with the D7000, or poor engineering that prevents proper function. It is possible that the PhotoTrackr works for other cameras, but not with the D7000.  If you buy one, save all your original packaging because you will want to return it.",15097.0

I'm not a hyper sensitive person, but this smells you're in a small, poorly ventilated room with an open gasoline container. It gave me a headache after using my Kindle for 1/2 hour. It's literally that strong of an odor. It's also a bit bulky but no more than I expected from the pictures on Amazon. I tried airing it out for a few days, and even put it in a small box with two fabric softners wrapped around it overnight in the hopes of them absorbing the smell. No dice.

Nope. Not even close. You can do nothing even close to that.      What it does allow you to do is use your phone's voice recognition functionality to make voice activated calls. So basically, this just allows you to use your phone's speakerphone function over the bluetooth function. Useless.

Well, the software is horrible. The playback/recording of your tracks comes out with a horrible static and bursts of what is best described as distortion. It is unmanageable to play, record, or listen to. That is if it plays withotu a error box popping up.    Moreover, the customer service is horrible. I spent a little over a hundred dollars for this item. I then had to spend 40 dollars to contact customer service, for which I held nearly two hours for. When the man finally picked up, he informed me they did not offer customer support for Pro Tools SE. Thankfully, he refunded my money for the phone call, but told me they cannot refund my purchase. He told me I had a software issue and would need to upgrade to Pro Tools 9 or something better to avoid the problem I am having. Which makes this purchase that much worse. I was told this would be a mini-studio now it won't work unless I spend hundreds of dollars to upgrade. Then to top it off the guitar store where I bought it won't take the whole mess back because of the copyright problems with the UNUSABLE software CD sold with the kit.

So, I decided to call the maker, Minisuit, to see if they could provide helpful suggestions - again, I was worried about breaking the product or my new nano.  Well, the customer service was below par and essentially laughed at me because I could not get the nano in the band.  I requested a video or more photos to make sure it wasn't user error - those requests were denied.  Long story short...turns out the clip is suppose latch through a slot in the back to secure the nano in place except...the slot is too small!!!  As in, waay to small!

Then it began restarting and re-recording. The card included in the box was a Transcend 2GB SD card. I got the same result with a Transcend 32GB SDHC Class 10 card. The device recognized the card, and alternated between working fine, restarting itself, and telling me that the card wasn't inserted properly. GRRRRRRRR.    The device automatically divides the video into 3-minute segments. If it records for an hour, you should get 20 segments. When the device restarts itself every few seconds, it begins a new recording, littering the disk with dozens and dozens of unplayable files. The only way to tell if the file is playable is to try to open it. If it's bad, you have to close the app (by force), then restart the app, then reselect the folder, then count your way down the file list to where you left off. Rinse and repeat over and over and over and over ad nauseum. Double GRRRRRRRR!    The software \\""looks\\"" nice, but needs to be more robust. Some files returned an error message and shut the app down, while others just locked the app completely. And each file gave the exact same result each time. The ones that returned an error message ALWAYS retuned an error message. The ones that froze the app ALWAYS froze the app. I don't know what the distinction was between the different types of unplayable files, but at least it was consistent. Still, if a file is unplayable, the software should be strong enough to present an error message without completely melting down.    It's also important to note that when I arrive at a destination, I unplug the power from the side of the unit and remove it from my windshield. Once unplugged, the LED's remain lit for several seconds, presumably as the recorder \\""closes\\"" the file it's writing. Because of this, I've eliminated the possibility of there simply being a loose power connection (which would have ordinarily been my first conclusion). I also had a brand new battery installed at the dealership less than 2 weeks ago.    So...in short (too late?), the device and accompanying software are flaky. I suppose the software would be just fine if the files were playable, but most of them are not. They manage to bring out the worst in each other. Five stars for quality and features when it works minus 4 stars for not working worth a darn. We'll see what the return policy is, because Amazon says the seller hasn't disclosed one. :-/    Oh, and the manual's a joke.

It shows in stock but after 3 days when they were supposed to ship, I got an email saying the item is not in stock. I checked on Amazon and it was still listed everywhere as in stock. Not sure why.. they didn't explain why :( . Then I selected different color and asked them to confirm what itme they are shipping. I had to spend 2 days with them (on email) making sure they are shipping right item. After several emails, they send me a link of the case they are shipping and it was totally different. I specifically asked them to send me ASIN number of the item but they didn't. I am not sure if they had good intention of giving me the same item.    Then, they were supposed to ship on time, which they missed 2nd time.. and today is 10th..

There's your one star!<br /><br />Paying over $1000 for a system, solely for a name that you expect to be quality, is not what you get with this unit. Every other item, which is usually pre-installed with most units is a separate purchase. I purchased the BT connector - now everything paired fine, I hear the other party clearly, and no one can hear me. I contacted Alpine numerous times via email, without ever getting a reply. I finally got through to them and explained my problem; they stated \\""That's strange.\\"" I was told that they felt it was the microphone - so they sent me a new mic. Still, same problem, they then stated it must be the BT unit - they said they would send me a new one.

I gave up on that and took it as a loss.<br /><br />The navigation system is horrendous - specific locations don't exist.

I am an electrical engineer and the transmission power this thing puts out is pittiful. Yes, it will broadcast to a clear fm channel on your radio. However, the tranmitter must be litterally sitting right next to your radio or on your dash for your radio to even get the signal. And because the transmitter signal is so weak it results in some other problems:    1) The audio is low and faint. Even with the volume turned all the way up on the ipod, the audio is not very loud, resulting it the background noise being amplified, thus you get a noisey signal.    2) Because the transmitter is extremely weak, the radio has a harder time locking into the signal. That is why people experience static with this device. Think of it like trying to tune in a very weak FM station in your town, or an FM station from 80 miles away - it goes in and out and has static that is very annoying.

I was looking for a replacement as it did not hold many songs, so anytime I wanted to add new songs, I had to delete some.  I specifically wanted a SanDisk product again, so I chose to buy this item.  I was a bit shocked at the low price, but figured I'd try it anyway.  I have one positive and one neutral point to make before moving on to the negatives.  Positive: SO easy to load music onto the player.  Just highlight the song on your computer and drag it to the Sansa music folder.  Neutral: the size and weight are great for working out, but you need to purchase the armband (and silicone protective case) to make it functional.  I guess you could clip it to your waist, but the armband + case are inexpensive and available on Amazon.<br />The negatives:<br />1. The sound is crap.  It sounds like AM radio, or like I am listening through a tin can.  Disappointing considering the other Mp3 player I bought years ago sounds better than the newer model.<br />2. The earbuds that come with the unit are too large for my ears.  I can't use them.  I understand that I can't expect to use the freebie earbuds for running, but I can't even use these sitting still.  I do have a smaller head(wear an XS motorcylce helmet), but this is extreme.  If I want to use them, I have to hold them up to my ear.  That's the best I can do.<br />3. Earbud connection point does not fit snugly into unit, therefore music \\""skips\\"" with almost every step.  Ugh.  This by far is the worst part for me, since I use the Mp3 player for running.  Now, perhaps the earbuds that came with the unit work just fine, but how would I know since I can't actually get them into my ears?  At first I tried to use my current sport earbuds (previously used with the other SanDisk Mp3); I had to play with the connection point so much to hear the music, it just wasn't worth it.  I then purchased a pair of $30+ earphones.  Again, the connection point does not fit correctly, so I need to leave them only partially plugged in.  This in turn causes the music to crackle or skip, which is extra disappointing because half of the point of digital music is that it isn't supposed to skip.<br /><br />Edit: After using this for 1 month, I have changed my original rating from 2 stars to 1 star.  I just can't deal with this device anymore.  The music cuts out every time my left foot hits the ground.  I am either going to start using my old Sandisk again, or search for a different product.  I should have known better than to purchase electronic equipment that does not come with a warranty.

I bought two books the next day, one of which wouldn't download to the reader.  I called Sony and was told they would fix the problem as soon as possible.  They offered a [...] gift certificate tocompensate for my trouble.  They were to advise me when the fix was accomplished.  After about three weeks I started calling to find out what the status was and was always just told it would be done as soon as possible.  The information that came with the unit gave start-up information but gave no particulars.  The reader had trouble accessing the dictionary and performing other basic tasks.  Since I had no inforation on how the reader should work, other than that I should get about 7500 page turns from a full charge, I called every few days to get help.  At one point I asked if there was a product guarantee for something that had bought over the internet and was told that, no, there was no such thing.      After several about problems and about the situation for the book I was waiting to receive, I was told that the book problem takes 2 months as tghe publishefr has to  be contacted.  That didn't make me happy, but I accepted it.  I was irritated that they had books in their store which weren't compatible wuth the reader.  It seems a simple thing to make sure of that before they put something out for sale, but maybe it isn't.      After many calls about different problems I was finally told that the reader would have to be sent back for repair.  The repair would cost [...] since it was slightly over 90 days since I had received it.  That, too, upset me but again, I complied.  The reader was to be back to me in two weeks and it was in just over that.  However, it still had problems after it was returned.  One thing was that the battery only lasted for a few days and it drained even when the reader was turned off.  Many more calls and much frustration later, I was again told to return the item.  When I received it back the second time, it still had pfroblems so I called and ask what had been done both times it had been returned and was told that the first time they replaced the battery and the second, the main board.  However, they hadn't managed to fix the problem.  On the 3rd return they told me that they would be sending me a different unit, a refurbished one, which would have all the problems repaired and would be good.  This solution was irritating as the original reader was new and it seemed unfair to me that it would be replaced with one that was not new with no compensation for the difference in the cost of the two units.  They told me, however, that that was their right.      When the refurbished unit arrived I was quite happy as the screen was clearer and all the functions responded quickly.  However, the battery drained very quickly.  Whey I called and made the company aware of the situation, I was told to plug the reader into the computer and hit the reset button.  I questioned them if they were sure they wanted me to do that as that same instrion with the first reader had caused it to freeze but they said that was what I was supposed to do.  Again, it froze and I was told to return it.  After about a week and a half, I was again called and told that they would. agaom. have to replace it with another refurbished unit.  That one arrived on Monday of this week and I chafrged it up and atgtmpted to read.  After approximately 8 hours of use, the battery life had diminished by half.  I called this morning and was told the technician would have to call me back.  A few hours later I attempted to use the reader but it wouldn't even turn on.  It would turn on but before I could access the list of books, it would go off again.  I don't know if it is a battery problem or what because I couldn't get far enough into tghe turn on process to get the battery icon displayed.  I am still waiting to hear back from the technician but expect to have to call back tomorrow even they assured me I would hear within 24 hours.  They have my number and realize that I will be angry.  If anyone is interested in learning more details, I can be contacted at [...].  My total experience with Sony has been horrible.

The device is claiming to be capable of doing much more, like communication with third rider, GPS connection, excellent battery live, etc.  Maximum working range claim to be impressive.  The devices I have tried to use with this set: Nokia E71, Blackberry Curve, IPod with SONY Bluetooth Transmitter, I also tried my Lenovo Laptop.

And this is not a speaker's problem it is the actual device problem with Bluetooth A2DP protocol stack.  * Streaming music to rider and a passenger at the same time from one player is not possible.

Now that other readers have filled this gap, with the exception of maybe the epub format, this is a non issue.  However, if I'd really known all the bugs this thing has, I never would have given it notice.  Porting files into the device is VERY clumsy.  The desktop software is NOT intuitive at all.  When you set up \\""collections\\"" to organize your works, what happens is that upon using notes in the reader itself, the organization is DESTROYED; yes, it will actually remove books from their respective collections just because you've digitally highlighted text.  It is a major bug that I've contacted Sony about repeatedly, but after about a year later there is no indication that it's fixed.  The touch features are worthless; try to swipe and after 2-3 attempts it finally turns the page, so you end up never using touch when reading.  The USB charging is hit and miss, it will act like it's charging and all, but the next day you find there is no charge on the device; as a result of this, I ended up having to buy, separately, a wall plug-in charger.  Since the touch interface is added on top of the e-ink layer it has a significant and distracting amount of glare.  The server for the ebook store often hangs, and the integration with google books is a joke; it would just freeze up the software when you go to the google area.  If you point the desktop software to an rtf file, it will freeze up the software; and reloading the application doesn't help since the pointer to the file remains and it will just lock up every time you load.  The only solution I could find was to move or delete the rtf file itself.    So, all in all, I strongly recommend people avoid this product.",14820.0

The product description on Amazon's website states \\""By supporting both industry standard formats, ePub and PDF...\\"" creating an impression that one will be able to read PDFs. Maybe they mean something else by 'support'. Well you can't in most cases even when you officially download files, no piracy involved. Papers from journals that distribute PDFs to subscribers for instance. The pages are shown as diminutive images by default, and when you try to enlarge letter size they are not displayed correctly, so you see only part of the page; and there is no way to solve this other than by converting the whole file to RTF as I understand. I wonder if Sony and Amazon can legally claim the thing supports PDF? I will try to return my device because I think I have been misled by the product description. The funny thing is that some other e-book readers do display readable PDFs, not perfect but they do. And this problem existed for several years but Sony didn't bother to solve it. Oh, and the whole software system feels like 50 years back in time. Very rigid, no options to do things that are long expected as standard on comparable devices.

After 2 emails asking the not to do this and explaining the situation, the response I got was that I would have to pay shipping and a 15% restocking fee!

The longevity of these is highly suspect, and given the complex installation (I had mine professionally installed as noted above), I can't see self-troubleshooting this issue.  If I had to do it over again, I'd buy something better.  Steer clear of these, unless you want to roll the dice.    **ORIGINAL REVIEW**  Comments from the installer:  1. These posts are the old style.  The newer units come with screw in adapters.  This type will not allow a tight fit, nor allow the headrest to stay up with notches.  2. These units will vibrate unless you secure them to the seat with some kind of epoxy.  But then, you won't be able to raise them (which won't function properly anyway with the sleeve adapters).  3. You paid a great price for these, even given the limitations.    Comments from me:  Everything he said was true.  The units work as advertised, and the looseness of the posts is noticed, but not horrible.  I hardly notice.    The sound quality of the IR headsets is laughable.  I would not waste any time using these.  Situated directly in front of the unit, there is clear distortion.  Move right or left even a few inches and the sound signal is lost.  Clearly, you will be using different wireless IR headsets, wired headsets, the internal speakers or the radio transmitter.  The other 3 options seem fine.  I can't comment on radio transmitter in urban areas - the signal will probably degrade.    The video quality is OK.  Not stellar.  Comparing quality to the factory unit in our 2010 Sienna Limited is very noticeable.  Expect to get what you pay for here, but that said - the quality is still acceptable for the application (keeping kids quiet!).    All in all, 3 stars is because of the mounting post limitation, wireless headset audio, video quality and installation instructions.

With ITunes and other programs, why do you want something else taking up room on your computer?  No Wiireless, not a single-unit product, charger specific (it would have been nice if I learned this from Sony and not a fellow dissatisfied customer), horrible and impractical battery life, stupid idea for a stylus (scratch up your touch screen when you spend the bulk of your time reading from it) and, honestly, a far more limited selection of books on Sony's Reader Store.  The fact alone that there's no wireless and self-storage on this model shows it to be a poor competitor for the Kindle, and while we like our creature comforts, in exchange for a touch screen, I have an \\""E-book\\"" that died on me during a trip, did NOT charge because no one told me you need a specific USB outlet adapter even though the Reader will show a USB connection, and left me having to buy a book instead.  The \\""written word\\"" folks opposed to E-Books are saying \\""I told you so\\"" right now.  I think Amazon considered a lot of issues presented by the E-Book concept and addressed them BEFORE they released the Kindle:    -Efficient power consumption, wireless capable, stand-alone downloading and book storage, portable, offers a large selection.  Only areas to improve: larger screen and more widespread wireless connectivity (oh, that's right, they've done this already).    Sony:  -No wireless capability (a laptop/desktop is req'd.), smaller unit book storage, more limited selection, unclear instructions on turning off unit (it goes to sleep first, you have to hold the power button longer to switch it off), charger specific combined with really bad battery life, a touch screen to ease use (though it's def. no IPod Touch), more expensive for really a whole lot less than what you get for a Kindle.",14635.0

I have read numerous professional reviews and everyone focuses on how well you can read the screen. Important to be sure, but since there are several alternatives the usability is equally important. Since its not a book, you have to constantly deal with the following usability issues:    First, it has a built-in dictionary. That's awesome. Double tap a word to bring up the definition. Great. What happens when it doesn't know the word? More importantly, when its clearly an adverb or adjective form of a word. It tells you \\""no definition found\\"" and that's it. You get no option to edit the word so you can look up the root word. If it DOES know the definition, you are given the option to edit the looked-up word to get a new definition. For example. It doesn't know the word \\""sonorously\\"". It would be nice if then allowed you to edit the search term because you as a human can clearly see \\""sonorous\\"" is the root word. No, you're forced to look up a word it does know, only so you can tediously erase it and type in the root word you're looking for. And trust me, you want to do as little typing on this as possible. Purely awful.    Second, you can't read a book while its charging! They say it keeps a charge for 10 days. My experience is that it lasts 10 days whether you use it or not. Very frustrating to not read for 2 weeks, go to lunch with your book and find out its out of battery when you knew it was half full last time you used it. Oh, and if you have a charger (it's just USB), you can't charge it and read it. Actually what's worse, is if you hook the INCORRECT USB charger into it, it won't charge BUT it thoughtfully tells you its hooked up to USB, giving you no options to read a book nor any indication that it isn't charging, providing you with the illusion that its charging. Thanks. I though we had realized all chargeable devices should be usablewhile charging. Even my crappy cheap phone does this! Edit: I've been told the button that is labeled \\""Power\\"" that I used to turn it off does not actually turn the device off, but instead puts it to sleep, so the battery may last longer. Holding the power button for a few seconds turns it off apparently. Consider the usability on a button that is labeled by what I would call its secondary function.    Third, navigating to books is tedious if you have a large library. You get a list of books `by author', `by title', and `by date', but it still lists all books. By author is not, select the author then the book. Its just raw sorting. The slow page turning of e-ink isn't really a problem when reading a book, but when trying to go through a long menu, its irritating. Now, they have a `collections' mechanism akin to a playlist on an iPod. But I don't want to predefine collections just for navigating.    Fourth, not setup for reading more than one book at a time. Who would do such a thing? Oh, I dunno, someone who buys a technical book to read at work, but reads a fictional novel during lunch. Yes, you can do this, but see my previous issue. The simple addition of maybe 4 `most recently read' books would solve this.    Fifth, the font sizes are inconsistent/less useful. You get small, medium, large, extra large, and extra extra large. There's really two issues here: First, the size of small in one book is not the same size of small in another book. And the granularity is horrible. I find myself wanting something between small and medium or between medium and large. Extra large and extra extra large are just plain ridiculous and I can only assume were included for legally blind people. XXL gets 10 lines per page. As I said, the slow page turning isn't bad, but is a little distracting and you want to limit it. 10 lines means your spending half your time waiting on page turns. I'd rather have more options of the smaller sizes.    Sixth, the margin isn't configurable. It wastes a half inch all around for a margin. The e-ink goes all the way to edges (you can see this in menus and the dictionary), but not in the books. I'd like to configure this as to me, the 3/4 inch edge of the device itself is a margin.    Seventh, the Sony Store is about what I expected from a 1998 website. Its very difficult to find what you want. You can't narrow a search to an author or book title. When you type in an author's name, you get many matches of books not written by that author. I'm not sure if they did the prologue, left a review, or are in the same style, but its not the author. Oh, and the author you searched for isn't always listed at the top, so if you get 5 pages of matches, you really have to search them all. Oh, and there's no sorting by author (but there is by title).    Eighth, the reader software (that you use on your desktop to load books) is also what I expect from 1998. It looks like an iTunes rip-off with a tree on left showing books, audio, pictures, etc, and a list on the right. It's ugly, boring, slow, buggy, it crashes, it locks up ... (the recent 3.1 update may have fixed some of the bugs, but none of the usability). Specifics: it lacks many of the same features of the reader with respect to listing books. There is extra info about a book (like the file name) that you can only obtain by reading the book, then hitting the info button. Its not an option when listing all books. Also, once you start reading a book, its not obvious how to stop reading it. You'd think just hitting `books' on the left would do it. Nope, you're in `reading mode'. You have to hit a `list' or `grid' view button. There is a `play' button to put you into read mode, but its at the bottom. The list and grid views are at the top. So they don't seem to correlate, but in fact, they do. And since you bought the reader device, you probably won't read much via the software and will find yourself forgetting how to get out of read mode.    Ninth, things like the option menu. When reading a book you can hit a hard Options button to do things like change the books orientation (landscape or portrait, not hetero/homo). This amazing menu is 6 items long with a `more' button. The more button displays a whopping 3 more items. Why not just show all 9 items at once! There's plenty of room! Now consider the slowness of e-ink. That's the type of usability issues that are littered throughout this device.    Tenth, the whole touch thing. I'm not against touch interfaces if implemented properly. You can just swipe your finger to change the page. Well, maybe 30% of the time. It doesn't always work. Maybe my fingers aren't sized properly or somehow I haven't mastered how to `swipe' (funny my iPod touch has no such problem). I have to use my fingernail to get it to work reliably (simulating the stylus that I don't want to pull out to change pages). Also, I did a swipe vertically from the bottom to the top and it interpreted that as a page turn. Huh? You might think, \\""why would do such a thing?\\"" And I'd reply, \\""the screen gets dusty despite having it in a case. I'm swiping dust off of it in a manner that is clearly not a page turn gesture so it won't turn the page\\"". Then there's the double tap a word to look it up. Usually this works, but sometimes it selects a word that is literally inches from where I tapped.    Lastly, their technical support is friendly, but pretty unhelpful. Why would I need technical support for a book? Well, this one book I bought (from their own store) has numerous pages that show only \\""Protected Page!\\"" (instead of the actual page). It does this on the reader and in the desktop software. They wanted to lead me down the obvious paths (which I told them first off that I had tried) but in the end were unable to resolve my issue and I've got a book that I can't read and locks up my reader if I try (did I mention that?). That and I hate to say this, but I could barely understand their accents. I tried to do it over e-mail, but this problem was too difficult for that according to them.    Oh, one last thing to consider: if you have to reset the device (I have had to do so at least 3 times), you lose your bookmarks. Kinda really irritating.    In this day of iPhones, the usability on this should be better. And hopefully, someone at Sony will read my review and resolve these issues with a Firmware update. I certainly won't buy the next model if they fix them but require a new purchase.",14591.0

The firmware software update does NOT work. The correct files are not on the included mini-disk.  2. The manual is useless and is so poorly written that its nearly nonsensical (it just doesn't make sense).  3. The seller's website is [...]  (try it - there's nobody home)!!!!!  4. This is a cheap Chinese knockoff of the iPOD and I'm guessing the warranty is about as good as their webpage (they'll disappear after Christmas).  5.

No way this thing is going to stay together if you drop it or pull it out of a pants pocket.  This is a two piece shell.  It's only held together by a millimeter high protruding rectangle (on the back), which fits into a corresponding rectangular hole on the other half of the shell.  It requires very little force to pull apart.  There's no way I'd try to pick it up by just the top or bottom of the shell, the chances of it pulling apart are too great.    The plastic screen cover arrived with a long vertical scratch down the front (and many other minor scratches), and is too thick to be useful.  The screen cover is also not adhesive based, which could easily result in dirt getting trapped under the screen cover, scratching the glass over time.  It's also not able to stick close enough to the screen, which results in an odd distortion when combined with the extra thickness.    The back edge of the case protrudes slightly out from the back of the iPod. This causes another problem, as it makes it extremely hard to depress the volume controls on the side, as the case sticks out nearly as far as the volume controls.  I had to turn the entire assembly sideways and push with an index finger to get the volume to change.    On the plus side, the blue color is a very nice look, and the outer side of the plastic shell does have a nice frictionized rubber feel.  I later found another very similar case using the same plastic that uses a retaining clip on the top and bottom (I've been using the other one for 3 weeks, and have no major complaints).  This one will end up in the trash     For reference, I used this on an iPod Touch 3G 32GB.

The core purpose of the reader is hindered by not being able to effectively and reliably transfer purchased books.     I have been following e-reader devices for over two years.  Always waiting for the \\""next\\"" device to come out, my wife rallied my family to go in together and surprise me with this reader for my birthday.  I was very excited and loved the device until I tried to purchase books for it.  The #1 problem was that Sony's eBook Library software crashed whenever I tried to transfer a purchased book to it.  Granted, I only purchased books from Sony's store so this may not be the case with other eBook vendors.      I'm highly proficient with computers and would describe myself as an early adopter for new technologies.  This is the most disappointed I have been with a device manufacturer in years.  The reason is that I love the eReader!  It is well built and has a great feature set.  Getting books from Google and local libraries is a great option and works great (I did it).  But Sony completely dropped the ball on their software to purchase protected books.  After 4 hours of trying to get it to work consistently across 2 desktops and a laptop I knew I couldn't keep the reader.  The final factor was when I realized this has been and remains to be an unresolved issue for past models of Sony readers as well.  Sony never appeared to resolve the issue for those having problems in the past and it persists to this day.    If the software works with your computer then I would recommend this reader.  However, based on my disappointing experience I can't recommend giving it a try.  I may find myself waiting until the best distribution and ecosystem, which I believe to be Amazon, finds its way onto the best devices.    Pros (+)  + Ability to write notes and highlight with stylus  + Very well built, looks and feels nice  + Touch screen navigation  + Removable memory slots  + Fun extra features - store pictures, listen to MP3s  + Free books - from Google and local libraries    Cons (-)  - \\""eBook Store from Sony\\"" software crashes when transferring purchased books  - Retail book selection much smaller than that offered on Kindle  - No wireless purchase option on this model - a big deal to me only because the software required to transfer books does not work well    A side note:  There is a way to adjust your system settings on Windows Vista using Data Execution Prevention to mitigate some of the problems.  However, even this did not cause the software to work consistently for me and I recognize that most people don't desire to go to such lengths to transfer eBooks.  Another option is to buy books from other eBook sellers and use Adobe's digital editions software to transfer books.  For me that wasn't a good enough option to keep the reader.",14526.0

Since the previous \\""Crystal\\"" model and the new \\""Crystal EV\\"" model both use the same pendant/battery pack, one assumes Myvu rotates their stock, so these viewers are shipping with the oldest stock of pendants FIRST with a rechargeable battery life of \\""ZERO\\"" to \\""???\\"".

The reader library software for the Mac is incredibly slow to react and what is the worst, though I was able to purchase books from the Sony store right away, every time I tried to send the DRM bound books to the reader, it gave me an \\""oops the store is not available just now\\"" and when I clicked on the option on the \\""oops\\"" message to return to the store the software says the store is not available -- yet I can easily get to the store to buy more books by clicking on the access store box shown elsewhere on the screen. At least the purchased books were readable on the computer. After spending a lot of time trying to figure out what was happening based on the provided documentation, I downloaded the full manual and by reading page by page I found that the reader has to be authorized for DRM books separately from the computer. None of the documentation that came with the reader says that. Why doesn't the error message that pops up when you try to send DRM books to an unauthorized reader say that the reader still needs to be authorized and then automatically send you to the authorization site instead of saying that the store is not available? I spent most of the day trying to get the thing to work as advertised and in the end more or less succeeded but at this point all I can say is it is not ready for prime time. I have been able to transfer non DRM books and PDF files to the reader with no problems and after figuring out that the reader had to be separately authorized for DRM books, I managed to even get the purchased books to load on the reader. So it is useable though I have issues with the low sensitivity of the touch screen when using fingers instead of the stylus and I find the location of the page turning buttons inconvenient. The experience has not been pleasant and having to figure out workarounds for several software problems should not be necessary. Maybe I amspoiled by the ease and simplicity (and reliability) of iTunes and iPods. I hope the Kindle is more user friendly. Sorry Amazon, I went for the Sony because I have many books in PDF format and the Sony unit seemed more user friendly for PDFs -- and it does do PDFs just fine -- but I think going through the conversion process to use PDFs on the Kindle might be less hassle than what the Sony unit has put me through.

I really bought the system because it fits well in my Jetta TDI and provides a large display for the GPS. I don't really plan to watch DVDs on it.    About 80% of the time that I want to use the GPS functionality, the GPS system restarts after I agree to the conditions of using it. When I then pick a destination it hangs up during the calculation of the route. If I keep it in that state, a bit later the music from my iPod stops playing as well. To get going again I have to flip down the screen and reset the GPS. All in all annoying for what Alpine calls 'the best in-vehicle navigation and entertainment system'.    I also noticed that if I try to only turn the voice prompt for the navigation system off, the alert sound stops as well.    When I talked to the Alpine service people, the first things they seem to worry about is not that their product is faulty, but whether I bought it from an authorized Alpine dealer. After getting over this hurdle, they do acknowledge that there is a problem that probably will be fixed by a free software update they hope to have available in about a month (so I assume by the end of September).    I really want to like this system, so I keep hoping that the update fixes my problems.    UPDATE: Yesterday on a trip to Hanover PA going by Gettysburg, PA, the GPS system suggested at one point in time that (with the settings for the shortest route) that I still had 21 miles left to go and it would take about 30 minutes. After ignoring a turn I knew would not get me where I wanted, it suddenly realized that the distance was really 11 miles and it would take me only 15 minutes....  I am glad I knew the best way to get there, because the GPS would have completely steered me wrong. That makes that I can't really trust this system at all.    I am hoping that the update will fix this kind of problems as well.",14482.0

They are powered monitors and can be linked and controlled by one remote, which would allow me to do without a power amp (cool!).    Each speaker has an analog input, an AES/BEU digital input, and a s/pdif digital input which can be daisy chained from one speaker to the next. This was great, I thought, as I could take my digital s/pdif surround signal from my PC and route it straight into the speakers. There are dip switches on the back of each one where you can tell it to be the Left, Right, Ls, Rs, or Center channel.    After a week researching, buying, and climbing in my attic stringing spdif and analog cables, I hooked it up and tried watching a DVD. To my horror, the speakers were only producing stereo, with duplicated L/R signal in the surrounds and combined in the center.    Turns out the spdif is STEREO ONLY (IEC 60958) not IEC 61937, which is used to carry compressed signals like Dolby Digital, DTS, etc. Turns out you need THREE PAIRS of spdif outputs if you want 6 spdif signals. And no sound card or DAC that you will find here on Amazon has more than ONE.    I referred my JBL contact to the wiring diagram in the manual for the subwoofer which shows a workstation with three spdif outputs. I asked what it was. He said \\""That's a Pro-Tools HD computer.\\"" Those cost $10k for the base unit and even the $2500 Digidesign 192 Digital interface only has ONE spdif output. The hypothetical DAW in the diagram does not exist. FRAUD!!!!!    Later, I was referred to a couple of sound cards by Lynx, one costing $700, the other over $1000 that would output 8 channels of AES/BEU...not spdif, which means I would have to totally rewire the speakers. More expense, back to the attic...a toasty 115 degrees here in Texas.    The only way to use these for surround without spending that kind of money isto use them with a 6X6 (or greater) digital interface, producing six analog outputs which you can either plug into your board, eating all your inputs and outputs, or go straight from the interface to the speakers, monopolizing the analog inputs of the speakers. And that's just for audio production. God help you if you want to hear surround sound while watching a DVD. Who knows if you could actually tell the DVD software to use these six outputs. And when the boys come over to play, rewire using the mixer outputs. Head...hurts...    If you just need a PAIR of powered monitors these are fine. But unless you have tens of thousands of dollars of Pro Tools equipment, don't believe JBL's lies. These are an expensive nightmare to run for surround. Their answer to me when I complained? \\""You don't like 'em? Dump 'em.\\"" The guy took every opportunity to tell me how these were meant for \\""professional\\"" applications and that I needed to spend more money. I finally got tired of being condescended to and belittled and gave up. Analog it is for me and my pathetic little project studio (i7 based computer with 6TB total of HD storage, 20 channel firewire Helix board, Sennheiser mics, Roland drums, Martin, Gibson, Ric, and Fender guitars, Boss GT-10, etc etc etc.) Funny how their advertising specifically targets project studios, but only ones with $15,000 Pro Tools systems.    So to get over my new inferiority complex about my pathetic studio, I am going to buy some Genelec monitors and dump this poorly made, low rent JBL crud forever (after being a loyal, exclusive customer for 20 years.) Did I mention that two of the monitors had defects right out of the box severe enough to warrant being returned and replaced?    So JBL, sorry I was stupid about spdif, but if all your advertising specifically talks about surround sound, you might want to make sure the flavor of spdif you are using is the kind used with surround sound.

So i saw this unit for 55 bucks or whatever and it looked JUST LIKE A BlueAnt Interphone. So for the price,i figured it was a knockoff but i had no idea just how different it was going to be.By the way,there is a good happy ending to the story. I already owned a REAL BlueAnt Interphone but had to modify the mic element,too much wind noise,but got it to work well.  So i open the box and see \\""INTERPHONE\\"" \\""USER MANUAL\\"".It was almost exactly like the real one but a bit shorter in length. Then i noticed on the main unit that there were no volume buttons. To pair two interphones together,you have to use the volume buttons. There went my idea of using the knockoff as an intercomm with my passenger. One button and one button only. One function and one function only.Pair with your cell and listen to music via the cell output to the fake LOOKING BlueANT.Then i read the instructions and found out it would be useless,just like the other unit i purchased from this company. At least there werent 2 different product photos with different features on them in the add like the last one.  Now to business. It has the same input cord thats used for charging and mic and headphone. To charge the unit you unplug the mic/headphone[single speaker]and plug in the wall wart. But wait,somethings wrong here!????They sent me a 220v plug,argh!  I will keep this short. Dont expect to intercomm,dont expect to pair to other devices well and at 160ma battery,dont expect to get the 4 hours of talk time listed in the book.[ The real one has a 350ma in it]. If your playing music THROUGH your cell into the headset expect maybe an hour or 2.  So it ends up i switched helmets and re-installed my REAL BlueAnt Interphone.I must have broken a wire accidentally and blew the attached mic/earpiece. I figured what the heck,ill try the knockoff one and see if the pinouts are the same. Boy were they,and the speaker was much louder and better sounding!?Most important of all,the mic that came with the fake job sounded MUCH BETTER THEN THE REAL ORIGINAL INTERPHONE ONE~thank god i had this thing lying around,it really made one of my systems work rather GREAT.Go figure,for once i try to cheap out and it doesnt bite me. I now,after experimenting with most bluetooth helmet systems out there,including the ones built into the helmet[stay away from those!!!!]i use a Chatterbox XBI and connect to EVERYTHINGat once he he he,and the REAL BlueAnt for the other side of the helmet. Yes i wear 2. Lastly,the ac wall unit they sent in the box looked like it fit with the kit,however the output shows 220v OR 110v.At 500ma,thats half an amp to charge a 160ma battery. I hope it cuts it in half when using 110v cuz i wired it directly to the ac wall plug.[im electronic experienced,DONT do this yourself,it could be FATAL. The book says the blue light will blink when charging. When i plugged it in the blue light was steadily lit. I let it sit there for about 3 hours[book says 4 hours i think for a totaldischarged battery]and all of a sudden its now blinking. Did they get it backwards?If you buy one,and for the money if just using a cellphone i think its worth it,you are going to laugh pretty hard when you TRY to read the manual.Chinese to english must be very hard to do he he he,pj",14334.0

I hadn't touched it and it had been playing a song from my iPod in an okay fashion.

I probably would have been willing to pay for the quality and reliability of the big name, except that I didn't want to have to deal with iTunes. I knew I was taking a gamble on this no-name knock-off, but as long as I could just drag-and-drop files into a USB device and have it play them randomly for the duration of a morning jog, I figured not too much could go wrong.    Except that it doesn't play the files randomly. It just plays them in order, over and over. This shuffle doesn't shuffle. HUGE disappointment.    Plus, I was treated to a nice freak-out when upon connecting the player to my computer, my virus scanner, Avast, recognized its software (start.exe) as a Trojan. Since this player doesn't seem to have a proper brand or product name I could refer to, it was difficult to find out if this was a common or serious issue, but I did find one suggestion that Avast is prone to reporting false positives for this particular Trojan. On the other hand, I came across a story about a McDonalds-branded mp3 player that was recalled because it was supposedly shipped containing a Trojan, so I suppose it could happen. On the other hand again, I have to wonder if maybe there was never a Trojan at all, just another false positive reported by Avast that sparked a scare and a recall. I am about 90% sure that this player doesn't contain an actual Trojan. I ignored the warning and nothing adverse has happened so far, but it's definitely something to be aware of.    In short, I would only recommend this product if you have an aversion to iTunes or anything Apple, very little money to spend on a player, good system security, a healthy acceptance of risk, and a fixed playlist of songs you'd like to hear in the same order every time forever.",14093.0

The remote operates via infrared vs. RF.  This means you have to point the remote at the display (within 1 meter) for it to operate.  Any higher quality remote controls are RF.  My Tom-Tom remote makes the EX-10's look sick!    Phone pairing is easy enough but if you leave the unit on and leave the vehicle and then return, it won't re-connect.  You have to re-start the EX-10 to reconnect with your phone.  On the up-side, the bluetooth interface did upload my contacts and call history very well.  Too bad 1/2 of the display is taken up with useless logos so I have to wait for the full contact name to scroll across the screen (in VERY slow motion)to make sure I have the right person.  If you have more than one number for a contact, the contact's name will be listed several times but you will have no way of knowing which number you will be dialing.    If that isn't enough bad news for you, go ahead and buy the EX-10.  I haven't listed all it's faults here because I'm tired of writing.  If you buy one, you'll want to tell everyone to steer clear of this thing too!!",13980.0

It was enough to fill a small room with modest sound, and it looked pretty, and that's about all I can say that's positive.<br /><br />Then the CD player failed ... which was frustrating because the machine was less than 6 months old, and had received extremely light usage during that time.  I wrote a polite letter asking the manufacturer to have their nearby retailer (from whom I'd purchased the unit) replace it under warrantee.  They declined.  Not only that, they refused to even provide a complimentary shipping sticker.  Instead, they indicated that the unit's warrantee only covered parts, not labor nor shipping.  I was given an elaborate set of packaging requirements, along with an address in california that I had to ship everything to via insured mail ... entirely AT MY OWN EXPENSE, and that I also had to include a certified check for a pre-paid labor fee, and that the entire process would take a minimum of 6-8 weeks.<br /><br />As of this writing, I am sorely tempted to toss the unit in the garbage, because (doubtless by the company's own design) the cost of the packaging, shipping, insurance, pre-paid labor, multi-month delays, and sheer aggravation seems to be a carefully designed obstacle course to greatly minimize their warrantee responsibilities.<br /><br />At the very least, I'll be avoiding manufacturer until I see clear evidence that they're making progress in correcting the woeful reliability and warrantee issues I encountered.

The ear plugs sent with the Dolphin are only guaranteed for three months, which should tell you something.

The first thing I discovered is that it has a name. This unit is called the \\""Onda VX858.\\""    I bought two of these, to make sure that I wasn't going to write a bad review about an item that was just faulty. Unfortunately, both units worked exactly the same way, so heed my words carefully.    One thing worth mentioning is that I am a technologically savvy person. The things that I could not get to work were certainly the fault of the manufacturer. I spent a good four or five hours working with this unit, and nobody should have to take that much time to get a simple Mp3/Video player to work.     Due to a lack of hard data on this item, with the exception of people who were almost certainly paid off to write up a good review, *ahem*, if after reading this review, there is more that you want to know, just post it in the comments section and I will get back to you. Also, if this review helps you, I would greatly appreciate you taking 30 seconds to let me know in the comments section. Now, to the review!    The Onda VX858 is intended to be the iPod Touch killer. Unfortunately, it really fails in almost all categories. Due to an extremely bad software design, it is almost impossible to get anything to actually play on this unit. Both music and video files of many different types simply did not work. More on that later.    First of all, the actual quality of the item is surprisingly poor. It does not feel sturdy at all. The plastic case is extremely thin and brittle, so I would expect this thing to break very easily. You can tell that it comes from a cheap factory in China.     The unit came with a stylus, cleaning cloth, an extremely cheap cloth sleeve, software CD, and USB cable. The VX858 does not have a place to put the stylus, though, so you have to carry it separately.     Upon first turning on the item, I found that all the menus were in Chinese. Since getting to the language changing function is almost impossible without knowing Chinese (you have to go through four text-only menus; no helpful pictures here), I had to spend about an hour just randomly changing settings until I got it. This is not a good way to start.    I finally got it to display English. The main menu had nine categories: Music, Video, Photo, FM, E-Book, Record, Navigation, Game, Settings.    Music: Music files can be dragged directly onto the unit hard drive. Unfortunately, there is no way to categorize or organize the music. You just have to find the individual track and have it play it (No albums or artist information was displayed.) I was able to get .wav files to successfully play on this unit, and that was it. Mp3 files would not play at all. No software was included that could convert .Mp3 to a format that the VX858 could read. Overall: D-    Video: This was the worst part overall. The VX858 cannot play any video files without having them converted with the included software first. Unfortunately, the included software seems to have been put together by one of the children that made this unit. It is all in Chinese and there is no way to change the language. I could not figure out how to use it. If you speak Chinese, then have at it, but for the rest of us, this is a huge letdown. There is absolutely no way to play video on this unit without using their software. Overall: What comes after F- ?    Photo: It displayed all formats of photos without a problem. This does not come close to redeeming the crappy music capability, and nonexistent movie player. Overall: A    FM: This unit is supposedly able to tune into FM radio, but I couldn't get it to work. It kept crashing and restarting whenever I tried to use this function. This happened with both of my units, so I suspect that this is commonplace. Overall: F-    Record: The built-in microphone is of poor quality, even for this piece of junk. Again, this was the case for both of my units. Overall: D    Navigation: The VX858 cannot \\""use\\"" folders. You store everything you want on the unit in one folder. This means that to get to your music, you have to go through all your files (which are not organized in any order, and cannot be organized) until you find the track that you want. This, frankly, sucks. Overall: F    Game: Tetris. That's it. You cannot put more games on here. This, and photo viewing, were really the only working functions at all.    Settings: Pretty basic, if you can deal with the Chinese default language, as described above.    The Touch-Screen: Works, albeit very badly. You will have to tap 2-3 times to get it to do anything.     Other notes: This unit does not have wi-fi capability.    In summary, this unit is an absolute failure. I had relatively low expectations, but the VX858 still disappointed me. This unit is just not worth any money at all.    Like I said, if you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to put them in the comments section, and I will get back to you. I hope that this has helped!",13818.0

The unit came faulty in that the two way communication won't work. It will only communicate one way.     2. Called crimestopper tech support and an arrogant personal picked up. Both he and I agreed the problem is either with the remote or the antenna, but he wants me to disconnect everything and send him the entire unit. Why go through all the work in disconnection and re-connection when the problem is only with the remote or the antenna?     Anyway decided to do that, so he transferred me to some other idiot to get the RA# and guess what.. he refused to do that. It seams I can only return it to the website I purchased it from.. They will not HONOR WARRANTEE IF I DID NOT PURCHASE IT FROM THEIR WEBSITE DIRECTLY :-D...     3. Asked if I could just buy another antenna or remote to save me the hassle of disconnecting everything... and it seams they don't sell anything to consumers!!! I have to send them the whole unit and they are going to charge me for fixing a week old defective unit!     4. I purchased an antenna from another online website. Adding the cost together, I might as well gone for a reputable unit like Viper, Compustar or Autopage etc... I made a \\""penny wise pound foolish decision\\"" going with crimestopper.     5. The range mentioned by them is nowhere close to what you get. My friend also bought a car with a crimestopper and its the same case with his too.     6. In my experience with autopage, bulldog, compustar, the crimestopper has the least customizable options. They advertize 30 customization possible, but none are really worth it. For instance, the remote has 4 buttons and a short press on any will do something to the vehicle like unlock the doors, open the trunk or start the vehicle. ALL other units have options to customize their remote like press two buttons together for any function so that you will not accidently press it. I cannot put the remote in my pocket because the buttons get pressed easily.     7. Crimestopper sells the wiring diagram for your car for $3.50. IT IS THE EXACT SAME ONE YOU CAN GET FOR FREE FROM THE BULLDOG WEBSITE. Isnt that enough to tell you what a ripoff company crimestopper really is?     8. The installation manual is as concise as it can be. I had to use it in conjuction with the bulldog installation manual to clarify things.     9. When I remote start the car with it armed (security active), the car shuts itself off after a few seconds. The vibration sensor shuts the vehicle to prevent theft!!!!!! The vibration of the car after it has started is shutting the vehicle off!!! I now have to unarm (unlock my doors) first and then perform a remote start. How stupid is that? Again goes out to show the quality of crimestopper products.     Overall, I just wish I had paid a little more and went with a respectable brand instead of crimestopper and dealing with their arrogant hopeless technical support staff, who are there just because they are not qualified to get any other job and do unleashes their frustration by troubling the stupid customers that purchased their product.",13781.0

First is the stunningly low price.  Second is all of the quality hardware.  A nice 3.5 color touch screen, the wonderful SIFR III GPS chipset and a new speedy 400 MHz CPU. The sleek device even sports a hidden antenna and a battery that is reported (on the box) to last up to 10 hours.<br /><br />An initial look at the software suggests that it is not a slouch here either.  The GPSmile 52 Plus can also be your media center with the ability to play MP3, video and even display e-books. You can customize your routes in many ways and even route multiple destinations in a single trip.  Wow, this sounds like a no-brainer, right?  Wrong!<br /><br />This is why I would not recommend this GPS unit:<br /><br />The unit clearly was designed for a British market.  Although, the accent sounds interesting the actual language can be confusing.  For instance, instead of saying \\""Turn right\\"" it will say, \\""Next opportunity turn right.\\""  It also gives distances in yards while all other GPS units I have used give distance in feet.<br /><br />OK, so you saying the above is no big deal, how about this.<br /><br />The unit has a very strong tendency to stick to the street.  When you are \\""off road\\"" like in a parking lot, the unit will tell you that you are actually on the street closest to you.  Sometimes these streets aren't even accessible to your vehicle leading to all sorts of confusion as the GPSmile 52 Plus will then calculate a new route based on this information and it will start to issue command like:  \\""Turn left in 75 yards and then left.\\""  This is extremely confusing.  Most other GPS units will say something like \\""off road\\"" or \\""please proceed to the route.\\""<br /><br />OK, if this doesn't bother you, how about this?<br /><br />The following three \\""experimental routes\\"" were run.<br /><br />Route One.  From an office building to my home, about 14 miles.  The unit had been set on my regular route choice (fastest).  First, it thought I was on the street instead of a parking lot and so the initial directions left out the first turn of the trip.  The computer wanted to take me to the toll way (reasonable) which normally would be the fastest route.  I chose to take some major streets instead as it was rush hour.  Other GPS units might try to get you back to the toll way once but then recalculate the route according to the new directions.  However, the Holux started to issue demands \\""Make a U turn\\""  (mostly illegal where I live) and repeated it every single block for about 4 miles.  I then stopped the car and cleared out the destination and asked it to recalculate.  The Holux wanted me to back-track to the toll way.  Here again it continually gave the command \\""Make a U turn in XXX yards\\"" over and over again until I had gone about 2/3rds the way home and had passed the toll way.  It was one of the most aggravating driving experiences that I can remember.  I have used other GPS units in this same maneuver without any problems.<br /><br />Route Two.  From the same office building I routed to my office about 6 miles away.  This would not involve a toll way so I was sure that the GPSmile would get it.  It correctly routed my trip.  I made the last turn with my office about 2 miles down the street on the left.  All of a sudden the Holux started to issue \\""in XXX yards, turn around.\\""  It did this several time which totally confused me.  It was only when I reached  my office that I realize that the unit wanted me to go a block past my office and make a U turn in an intersection so I would eventually be on the side of the street where my office was.  This would have been an illegal and dangerous maneuver.  Instead, I pulled into the parking lot at which point the GPSmile recalculated a route that ran me through several miles of residential streets.  This was despite the fact that I was at the destination. What would most other units do?  They would say something like, \\""Destination on the left.\\""<br /><br />Route Three.  From my office to my home, around 6 miles.  I was in the middle of my  large office parking lot so the unit didn't stick me on a street.  However, when it calculated my route it placed  me on the inaccessible residential court to the north of my office building.  If I took the instructions seriously the unit would have had me drive up an embankment, through a fence and into a backyard.  Then trough a house to reach the cul-de-sac. Not only useless, but dangerous direction.<br /><br />The GPSmile 52 Plus did not make me smile.  There are may cheap GPS unit available that do work.

I bought my reader last November and downloaded my first book.  I loved the reader. It surpassed my expectations until I attempted to download the next two books. Both books resulted in an error message.  I was charged for both books.  I can go to the library and find my books, but when I click on them to try to read them, I get a message that says I am not authorized to read them on this computer. I sent an e-mail help message and was totld that I would receive a response in 24 hours.  Three days later I still had not received a response so I called the help line. I explained the situation to the service rep and was told that he would call back later in the day. He never did. Over the course of the next 20 days I made a total of 10 calls and talked to a rep each time who told me they would call back later the same day. Not one ever called me back.  Finally after having my reader about a month and not being able to download books to my computer I called Sony and made arrangements to return the reader.  I included a letter explaining all of my attempts to get help from the Ft Myers, FL service center and I thought perhaps some would call me to talk to me about the situation.  I purchased over $30 worth of books which will not download to my computer and I was not re-inbursed for them.  It appears that Sony is intent on selling product but has no customer service back up.  It is strange that the 1st book loaded with no problem and after that would not download.  I still go to my account occassionally and try to re-download the books and it fails every time.  I loved the reader and would have rated it 5 stars, but it was worth exactly nothing if I could not download books to it.

However, if you have MP3s with album art, forget it.  I tried to get Creative's help with this, and got nowhere. <br /> <br />2) Some MP3 files will not play at all.  You get the message \\""The item is missing or damaged.  See Portable Media Center Help on your computer.\\"" <br /> <br />3) Some MP3s play, but with weird glitches in the first ten seconds or so.  It sounds like pieces of the file are skipped over at high speed.  This is repeatable (when a file has this problem, it always has the same glitches in the same places.)  Creative was no help with this. <br /> <br />4) Periodically the machine forgets it has an internal speaker (pull the headphones out of the jack and you hear nothing.)  If you reset the device then POOF, the speaker works again. <br /> <br />5) Though the PMC is VERY expensive ($500 for a 20Gb device that can only play Windows Media Video files?), Creative has never released an update for the buggy software.  I have been checking the Creative web site for a year and a half (since I got the player as a birthday present from my wife) and they have not put anything on there since 2004.  They released half a dozen updates for the Muvo firmware for my other player, but nothing for the PMC.  Apple updates their iPods, why can't Creative update their expensive clunker? <br /> <br />6) Creative will not help you with any problem after 60 days, unless you either buy their Support option or pay them $13 for a half-hour call.  They tell you to check the web site for information, but they don't even admit to the problems I have been having on their FAQs.  (I know they are aware of these problems, because I have read other people's complaints about the player, but they pretend the problems don't exist.) <br /> <br />One comment about the player itself.  The ergonomics are strange.  The rocker switch on the left only works when you are in the menu system; you cannot use it to skip from track to track while playing something.  The rocker switch on the right is not a \\""wheel\\"" type rocker, though it is circular.  There is no \\""up\\"" or \\""down\\"" on it, though it would have been trivial to use that for volume, which would have reduced the number of switches (and the cost of the product.)  Because there is a special button to escape to the menu system, you could have got rid of every button on the right, and had exactly the same functionality.  Maybe they needed a box big enough to hold the battery and hard drive, so they decided to fill the space with buttons. <br /> <br />There are preset buttons on the top of the unit.  If you press and hold one, it will \\""bookmark\\"" a song or video.  Pressing the button later will return to that content.  I have never had a use for this feature, and fail to understand what having four song or videos available by pressing one button is useful for.  (Maybe you need theme music when you enter a room?) <br /> <br />The video iPod is smaller, the Archos players play all kinds of formatted video, and virtually every other player in the universe can display the album art from an MP3 when playing it.  There is no reason to ever consider buying this player.  I am surprised Creative is still selling it.",13449.0

The fundamental design flaw is that the iPod Camera Connector powers the USB connection to the camera from the iPod battery, and transferring more than about 256MB of pictures will completely drain a fully charged iPod battery even on a brand new video iPod. <br /> <br />Because the photo copying interface on the iPod only allows you to download all photos from a camera, you can't start up where it left off, and you can't select a subset of the photos to download. In other words, there is no way to back up all of your camera's photos if you have more than about 256MB worth of photos on your camera. Most digital camera owners these days regularly use memory cards much larger than 256MB, especially when on long vacations. This makes the iPod Camera Connector completely useless for most people. <br /> <br />Another problem that arises when the battery drains during photo transfer is that the iPod forgets about ALL photo rolls that have been downloaded so far, even the ones that succeeded. To see the list of photo rolls again you have to press the secret button sequence that resets your iPod. And at that point you can't even view any of the photos in the rolls that were only partially downloaded. <br /> <br />These problems could have been avoided if Apple had only designed the iPod Camera Connector such that you could use your Apple iPod wall charger to provide power for the Camera Connector. These is a serious design error, and I'm surprised that Apple would release something so flawed in the otherwise excellent famly of iPod devices. Hopefully this will be addressed in a future version of the Camera Connector, but until then I wish I had my money back for the one that I already bought. <br />",13428.0

Yes it has all these preset crossovers, imaging, BBE etc., BUT NO ABILITY TO DIRECTLY ADJUST BASS/TREBLE! 2.Constantly displays ANNOYING ANIMATED GRAPHICS which are the same color as the screen text! You can't stop the animation! 3. There's only one face angle not multiple. It's either normal or almost flat. No in between. 4.1/3 of the screen's display shows the source and the clock (whether you like it or not).  <br /> <br />Now iPod related issues (keep in mind I'm using the iPac \\""DIRECT\\"" interface): 5. NO Shuffle or Repeat functions as these buttons are used for search settings. 6. Only displays Artist/Track# or Song/Track# in Display Mode 1 and in Display Mode 2 your option is Album or Track (can't displ Artist. Referring to #4/#6, IS SOMEONE REALLY GOING TO TELL ME IT'S MORE IMPT. TO DISPLAY THE CLOCK AND SOURCE THEN IT IS TO DISPLAY ARTIST,ALBUM,TRACK & TRACK# on the same screen? 7. Poor Search Capabilities. NO SCROLLING FUNCTION. To move 6 songs/albums ahead you'll need to turn the knob six \\""clicks\\"" or hit the remote button 6 times. Imagine trying to get to song 3000! Also, if you're on Elton John and want to go to Led Zeppelin, you'll start your search at \\""A\\"" not \\""E\\"" (Elton John). If you have multiple albums by the same artist, you'll have to go to their first album (alphabetically not by year released!) and then scroll through the tracks to get to the album you want to hear (BETTER HAVE THE ALBUMS MEMORIZED)OR search by album and start at the beginning of the alphabet....! Either option is poor when you're dealing with a large music library.  If you think turning the knob quickly will do it; NOPE! It just displays annoying numbers that have nothing to do w/ either the artist ortrack that you're looking for, so you have to guess how far to turn the knob before you get close to what you're looking for! 8. The remote's up bottom moves down the list and it's down button moves up the list (alphabetically speaking): BACKWARDS! <br /> <br />I honestly can't figure out what these designers are thinking when they design something like this and tell people they can use it w/ an ipod. If you're ipod has 20 or 30 songs, FINE. But this is a bad joke! So, you might be thinking you'll try Kenwood (KDC-X790). I tried it before Sony. It's even worse! It requires you to go through your library one song at a time! Imagine wanting to get to song 1500! No artist search. No album search! (Again, I was using their direct ipod \\""interface.\\"") It's radio functions are worse too. You have to hit two buttons each time you want to access a preset radio station..Uhh, I thought the whole idea of a \\""preset\\"" was to allow quick access to different stations!!!  MORONS! If you are considering using your iPod in the car and are looking for a stereo that will facilitate basic needs, DON'T BOTHER. Wait another year or two. It will take the manufactures at least that long to figure out how to create a solid interface. Quite a shame. \\""Common Sense Is A Dying Race\\"" <br />",13370.0

Among the problems I've had: <br />1) It absolutely will not display album cover art. I went through 3 rounds of e-mail support and two phone calls to Creative with no success. <br />2) Over half of my MP3 files will not play. The error message says \\""Item damaged or missing\\"" yet the item in question plays just fine on every single other device I own and plays just fine in WMP 10. Creative had no solution to this problem. <br />3) You can burn DVDs to your hard drive and then transfer them to the PMC. However doing so violates some copyright laws in some countries so don't expect help from Creative on this. Blame the content owners, movie studios, etc. for this. Suffice it to say if you dream of loading your DVD collection to this thing for long plane flights be prepared to spend extra money on encoding software and be prepared to spend many, many hours tinkering with encoding variables so the sound doesn't get all out of sync with the video.  <br />4) It's pretty much impossible to use one handed - unlike the iPod. <br />5) You can't transfer TV programs purchased from iTunes. Again, blame the studio owners for this. <br />6) It's prone to locking up. I have to carry a needle with me at all times so I can reset the machine when it locks up. This usually happens if you try to pause video. <br /> <br />On the upside, the tech support at Creative is very good. All my e-mails were responded to in 24 hours and I never waited more than 2 minutes to speak with a human being.

On paper, this product looks awesome, but I was let down and disappointed when I received it.  It was that disappointment you felt when Dad missed your 1st little league game.  This product is NOT worth $219.99.  It is NOT a good product.  While the product design/concept idea is great, the quality/craftsmanship is horrible.  This is my first MP3 player and I was looking for something that had it all and was reasonably priced (I got mine on sale for $99.99). I will list the pros and cons below. <br /> <br />PRO: <br />1) Has a built in USB connector (Player is designed like a beefed up Thumb drive with display) <br />2) Easy to learn graphic interface (I didnt need to read the manual, its that easy) <br />3) At 1GB, has lots of storage space <br />4) Drag and drop capability (You can use it to store anything) <br />5) You can delete files from the player <br />6) Multiple repeat/random configurations <br />7) You can increase/decrease the tempo of songs <br />8) Extras like FM tuner and voice recorder <br /> <br />You would think with all those PROs its a good deal; However, the CONs clearly show cheap construction. <br /> <br />CON: <br />1) Poor materials used for housing (Im afraid of breaking it.  Cheap plastic used.  Item is made in China.  Trim is painted in that fake chrome paint that flakes off given time) <br />2) USB cover cap falls off (Does not snap into place and if shook, the cap falls off.  You could loose the cap and not even know it) <br />3) Battery consumption horrible (They claim 12 hours on 1 AAA, when I only get 2 hours if I am lucky) <br />4) Battery cover loose (Comes off too easily)   <br />5) Shuts off for no apparent reason (While there is a sleep timer, I made sure this function was turned off and it still does it) <br />6) Cheap headphones <br />7) Arm band is universal/not designed for player (While exercising, player tends to shimmy out of sleeve)  <br />8) Arm band waterpermeable (Sweat soaks through arm band and gets player wet) <br /> <br />In short, there are a lot of great features and has the potential to be great MP3 player, but until Visual Land uses better quality materials and work the bugs out...Unfortunately I rate the player as a piece of Junk.

The info on artist, album or song title imports from the IPod very slowly. Turning the volume knob is equivalent to circling on the Ipod but one turn eqauls about 3 spots on the list unlike one circle on the Ipod which equals dozens of spots on the list. Therefore if you have a large catalog you have to spin the volume knob 100 times to get thru a long catalog list which takes forever........Very annoying, very slow, very cumbersome.

I was absolutely shocked to find that when I was installing the home adapter kit, the following was realized:    The power adapter plug and the audio cable (which would plug into the Auxiliary plug on your home stereo) are so close to the adjustable neck that it is *impossible* to plug both in (or even just one) without the SIRIUS tuner having to be adjusted upside down.  In other words, it is impossible to have the unit work and be able to see the display at the same time, which is not functional for being able to change channels and to view what is currently playing.  I was incredulous that such a beautiful product was now useless except for in the car and that I would have to send back the home system for a refund.    I do not see how Blaupunkt could have not seen this grave flaw in the testing period of their product as it is literally unusable.  I went out to their website to view the product information to see if I was missing something in my install ([...]  While I did not see anything that would lead me to believe that I was in error, I noticed that the website is advertising that the home unit includes a subwoofer output and that a remote is included (neither are), so be careful if you're going by their website in your research to compare products.  My conclusion was that while Blaupunkt employs great presentation designers, it confirmed for me that they're not paying attention to the details of their product offerings.    I have previously also owned the major competitor to the Blaupunkt package: the Audiovox Sirius receiver with the Audiovox SIRHK1 Sirius Satellite Radio Home Dock.  While I would like to recommend an alternative, the Audiovox system is seriously flawed in that it is incredibly difficult and time-consuming to get the tuner in and out of the car dock.  After a while, it became more trouble than it was worth as well.    Interesting, both units I've owned have had the same problem with the antenna connection (which looks fragile on inspection) failing after a few months of use -- and both occurred in two different cars!    For home use, I would recommend that until a company comes out with a system that is well thought out, functional, and engineered properly, the only alternative is the Kenwood DT-7000S Sirius Satellite Radio Home Tuner, which is probably perfect except that it costs $300 and the listener would have the additional cost of having to buy the Sirius service for that particular tuner, too.    In summary, the bottom line would be that while it sounds nice to be able to have a mobile Sirius tuner so that you could enjoy the music in different environments, be a careful consumer and read the experience from others before making the investment.
