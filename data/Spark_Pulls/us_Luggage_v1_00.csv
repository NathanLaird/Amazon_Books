The wheels are too small to keep the bag steady if you're booking through the airport or trying to make a shuttle: it rocks and flips, which is not any fun when you're navigating an airport. Additionally, the shape of the bag precludes standing it on it's side when you have to stop--it just falls over unless you take the time to put the flimsy handle away and lay it flat, which is a huge inconvenience if you're buying your pre-flight latte. Worse, it doesn't quite fit in the overhead bins since I opted to forgo the checked-baggage route on the way home.. I'm used to carry-ons being well designed and easily stowed overhead; not this bad boy. I had to fight with it a little bit and finally squish the top down because the handles got in the way.

The zipper aesthetically is beautiful, it is a bright gold, but a pretty zipper that breaks after ONE USE is garbage.<br /><br />As a point of comparison I have had a The North Face bag for over 10 YEARS and every zipper runs smoothly, because TNF puts high emphasis on quality.

When i received this back i was very excited. It has a distressed look and seems put together very well. After packing my bag, i picked it up one time from the two handles and placed it in my car. We drove to the airport and I walked the back by those 2 same handles to the pilot who was loading our bags on. When he picked up the bag, one handle ripped off from the stitching. I literally had just had the entire group who i was traveling with compliment the bag and the next moment I was embarrassed that the bag had lasted 25 minutes of use. Of course there was the large strap so i was able use that one which lasted me up to my room and back down to concierge before we left. When our car arrived on Sunday to pick us up, concierge brought my bag and had a awful look on his face. He was so apologetic because the large strap had ripped from the leather seems and was broke now as well. I now had no way to carry this bag but like i was holding a small child. This bag seemed like it was made so well but instead was very disappointing and embarrassing. I have used everything from cheap discount store bags to high end products but i have never had straps rip from the leather they are attached to.",16658.0

And, gosh, that felt like a name I could trust. Boy, was I wrong. They looked lovely enough when they arrived. But, upon our VERY FIRST usage of these cases, the zipper on both came open at the corners. So, here we are, on our way to France with our luggage duct-taped shut. Mind you, the bags were NOT overstuffed as we were bound and determined to 'make weight' and these were summer clothes we were packing, not heavy winter clothes. And, because I did the unthinkable and ordered the suitcases well in advance of the trip, it is now too late to return them. This experience has put me off of Samsonite luggage for good. And, I have to say, I am none too pleased with Amazon's return policy. When I purchase new luggage, and I will be orderining new luggage, it will NOT be Samsonite, and it will NOT be through Amazon.

Overall the case is fine - it held plenty for my last 8 day trip, but I was not impressed with the handle. Admittedly, I had a lot packed, but I wasn't anywhere near the weight limits and I just didn't have much confidence in the handle when using the &#34;spinner&#34; function so I defaulted to dragging it on 2 wheels, which sort of defeated the purpose of buying a spinner. I found that the handle's bars tended to twist when I tried to maneuver it on 4 wheels and at one point I was sure it was going to snap - not at all what I expect from a case I need to be durable! It looks good, but because of the color it quickly shows dirt (I had to check at one point because I'd bought some wine). I'll keep the case, but will be careful when &#34;spinning&#34;!",16654.0

I've used it on multiple airline trips and it fits very easily in the overhead bins of all the aircraft I've tried.

It is possible to access the mount for the wheels (the are secured with only three Phillips head screws on the inside, which you access vie an internal zipper) and I was able to swap the faulty wheel with its corresponding wheel on the other side of the bag.

I had done some pretty extensive research on them since the end of last year because I noticed a lot of kids at their school were using them and they seemed really efficient and durable, especially for up-er graders.  I was going to order the backpacks from J World's official website, but they offered minimal discounts, so the backpacks listed were too expensive for me to purchase two at once.  I checked here at Amazon and found several within a reasonable price range, so first I ordered a blue J World Sundance Rolling backpack for my son, but noticed they didn't have the same style in pink for my daughter.  I conducted another search via Amazon and found one for her that was just a couple of dollars more, but the order was going to be fulfilled by a different seller.  My son's backpack was shipped first and when I received it, I opened up the box and removed the plastic wrapping and inspected the backpack.  It was exactly how I expected it to be.  Everything matched up with the pictures I viewed on Amazon and the J World official website.  I was very pleased with the craftsmanship, vibrant fabric, concave wheels, stitched logos and the pull handle.  Everything checkout great!  When my daughter's backpack arrived a few days later, I noticed right away that the box it was shipped in didn't have any Amazon logos on it; and when I opened the box, the backpack was not in protective plastic (it looked like it was just thrown in the box).  When I pulled the backpack out of the box I noticed some very immediate differences in the craftsmanship compared to my son's backpack: 1) the wheels were totally different- instead of being a chrome-like concave wheel, it had 5-star spoke design 2) The pull handle was stamped with a horizontal black &#34;JW New York&#34; logo instead of a white vertical &#34;J World New York&#34; and the handle had a hard grip instead of softer rubber grip; it would also get stuck trying to push it completely down 3) the fabric look cheap and faded- there was actually a &#34;chalky&#34; fade mark on the front and the pattern didn't match up 4) The info/price tag was a different color- it was blue instead of purple 5) the zippers on the front were busting open in the middle and had crooked stitching 6) instead of the stitched rainbow logo on the front, there was a black &#34;J World&#34; button 7) the hooks for the shoulder straps were attached to a loop instead of being clasped in the molding of the backpack.  There were a few more discrepancies, but those were the most noticeable.  Looking back at the pictures of the backpack on Amazon, some were of the actual backpack I received mixed with a few of the authentic backpack's pics- so maybe the merchant was aware that these were fake.  I noticed the backpack is manufactured in China and unfortunately, their imports are known for having counterfeit items slipping into our marketplace from time to time.  Some merchants knowingly sell these items hoping that the consumer won't notice the difference and others have been just as surprised to find out they have sold consumers these counterfeit items because they may look very similar to the true thing.  I always do my best to research specs, study pictures on websites or thoroughly check out the actual product before I purchase it for a lower price online especially when it considered a high-end item like this.  These backpacks aren't cheap (in quality or price)!  And for good reason, because they are made very well, so to read other reviews about how the pull handles didn't work or broke after 4 months of use or how the zippers came apart after several weeks, etc.; that's a red flag that the item received was indeed a fake!  I've seen these backpacks a lot at my kids' school and they are usually durable enough that most kids have used them from 4th grade through at least 6th grade and they function justfine-  that's why I'm buying them for my twins.  Long story short, I returned the pink &#34;fake&#34; backpack to the seller at Amazon and ordered from another website who sold authentic J World backpacks for a great discounted price.  I recently, received that backpack and it looks exactly the way I expected it to and just like my son's backpack.  I look forward to having my kids enjoy them for at least the next couple of years without any issues.  I hope this review is helpful to anyone reading this.  It's not J World... their backpack line is top-notch.  The fakes being produced in China are giving them a bad name.  Thus, my reason for giving the one star to this particular seller on Amazon, but authentic J World backpacks get 5 stars from me any day!  Buying anything online can be tricky and I still love using Amazon as my go-to online marketplace, you just have to be careful and take the time to research before you buy so that you can develop a keen eye for spotting fakes like these.fine-  that's why I'm buying them for my twins.

I always carry this bag on the plane so it doesn't get any baggage claim handling.  I had a wheel fail on the bag in 2 months and contacted TravelPro and they sent me to a local repair person which gave me the run around.  The repair person said they usually don't cover a wheel problem and wanted to charge me $45.  I left and called TravelPro back and the customer service person asked me to send pics of a good wheel to send me another one.  Well I sent the pics and another email after 2 weeks and there are no replies from TravelPro customer service.  This is really no way to treat a customer!  The bag has failed after 2 months and it just looks like I'm out of the money for the bag as I can't carry the bag with a bad wheel.  The only other option is to pay $45 out of pocket for a wheel repair which doesn't seem right considering the bag is 2 months old.

Buy something else!,"Honestly, I thought twice before ordering this scale as it is the MOST EXPENSIVE baggage scale on Amazon! After reading all the good reviews, I pulled the trigger and ordered this scale for my upcoming trip next week to visit my sister on the east coast, and I wanted to be under the airline limit and did not want to risk buying a cheaper scale. I am very disappointed with my decision in ordering this scale. It looks pretty, but that's about it.<br /><br />As soon as I powered on the scale I got a EEEE message. The manual states that EEEE is overload, but the scale was not hooked to anything!! (I am guessing it is an error message). My first thought was that maybe the battery is dead. I had a battery on hand as my car's remote uses the same battery, and to my surprise, in order to change the battery, you have to unscrew a small tiny screw... unfortunately the screwdrivers that I had did not fit.... (honestly, if the battery dies when your away from home, do you take your tools with you?!??! - bad concept).<br /><br />The scale did not even work once, no matter what I push, I get the same message.<br /><br />In the scales box, there was a big flyer stating: Active your lifetime warranty.... really? I have to active it??? The flyer sent me to the sellers website to &#34;activate&#34; my lifetime registration, where I had to select the product I was &#34;activating&#34; surprisingly, there is no option to select a luggage scale...only some kind of locks....<br /><br />Another thing that really bothered me and is a flaw in design, is that once you hook up the scale to your luggage, if you don't hook it up the correct way (facing you) you have to unhook, turn the scale around and try again.... maybe if it works you can see which way is the correct way... I would not recommend this scale to anyone.<br /><br />I can't believe someone would pay top dollar for a product that is this bad....",16637.0

I bought 2 of these carbon fiber hard shell bags about 2.5 years ago and one was damaged (cracked) on arrival, so I was a bit worried. However, Amazon was great about sending out a replacement, so I kept them and have taken them on probably 25 flights over the course of 2.5 years.  The good: The wheels and handles including the retractable one have all worked really well and are still in relatively great condition  The bad: I should have listened to my gut when one of them arrived slightly cracked.  I though maybe a forklift or some machinery had somehow damaged it in shipping (even thought the box it came in was not damaged). Nope, these things crack, relatively easily. One arrived at the far end cracked, I assume from baggage handlers. The other cracked when my teenage son, doing what almost everyone does at some point, tried to putt too much stuff in it.  He got the stuff in, got the thing zipped shut, and a few moments later we heard a C-R-A-C-K. It split in 3 or four locations.  The built-in TSA 3 digit combo locks while a convenient idea, are junk. The combo is difficult to get set, and once you get them set and working correctly, they sometimes show up on the other end of a flight having somehow changed by 1 or 2 numbers. So when I would go to unlock them I have spent 5-10 minutes on at least 5 different occasions trying figure out what the combo has changed to. I am not sure if this is due to the TSA unlocking them and that somehow messing up the combo, or what causes it to happen.  The interior is just too plain and the retractable handle wastes a bunch of space making a large ridge in the center of that side of the bag. there are minimal pockets and the interior strap on the ridged side doesn't hold things in very well if you accidentally open the bag with that side facing down.  In general, I wish I would have never bought these bags. Waytoo much money for a sub par product. Too bad, because I used to be a huge Travelpro fan. Now I have found a couple Samsonite bags that seem to be treating right... (like the old Crew5 bags).",16637.0

256,US,22295096,R38B5U6MF6LCAD,B00WND0OYE,929975846,"Royce Universal Bluetooth-Based Tracking Device for Locating Wallets, Bags an...",Luggage,1,11,16,N,Y,Huge mistake!,"This was a huge mistake on my part.  I am a very anxious, obsessive-compulsive traveler, and thought this product would be useful in helping assure me that my luggage was where it was supposed to be.  To be fair, it accomplished that at first.  We took 3 bags to ireland, and I purchased 3 devices and placed one in each bag.  We only checked one bag, and I was able to confirm that it made it on my plane for the first and third leg there.  But the cost of the device was definitely not worth that very minor bit of assurance.  After that first flight, I lost the device that had been in the checked bag.  My phone app shows it located at the airport in Dublin.  No crowd sourcing data has emerged regarding it's location and I bet it was actually lost in the hotel where we first stayed.<br /><br />I have a second device sitting on my desk right now.  It won't make a sound when I push the button to activate it for sound.  But the better reason that you should avoid buying this product is this:  when it did work, the high pitched whine it made was never load enough to be much help in locating it.  I experimented with this and found first that I could not hear it if I was not in the same room as the device.  If the device was in a bag or covered in some fashion, it remained very difficult to detect.  The app gives very limited information to help find the device.  It tells you whether the device is near, close by, or out of range (there is perhaps a &#34;far&#34; in between close by and out of range, but I don't recall for sure--if so, it rarely shows up).  It can indicate that the device is near when you are on the second floor and the device is on the first floor, but somewhere more or less directly below you.  Yesterday, I was trying to track down the last of my three devices that remains fully functional.  I roamed around the house getting a near signal most of the time and a close by signal occasionally.  I activated the sound.  As roamed around the house I could hear nothing.  I kept trying to remind myself where I put the device.  Was it in one of the bags now unpacked?  No.  Was it my wallet?  No.  I finally remembered that I had placed the device in my backpack.  I went over to my backpack and put the backpack up to my ear.  Yes, yes.  I can hear it now.<br /><br />The above is a good illustration of how useless the device is.  The sound is so faint that you have to pretty much be able to recall where it is in order find it.  I've tried to think of useful applications for this very quiet device.  I think it is perfect for attaching to objects that my wife sometimes loses in her purse.  If you know it is in the purse, activating the device will make a loud enough sound so that you can narrow your search and locate it.  As for finding an object in a big house, it is only useful if you leave it out.  So it might work if attached to a set of keys left on a table.  Don't cover up the keys, however.  It might muffle the sound enough that you won't be able to find it.<br /><br />Another application that Royce Leather markets it the ability to find your cell phone if you have the device.  Squeeze the button on the device, and your phone will sound off with music or an alarm.  This works--PROVIDED that the app is activated on your phone, and PROVIDED that the screen of the phone is active and turned on, past any security settings.  As this is never the case with a phone that has been sitting for more than a minute or 2, the application essentially does not work at all in practice, and is completely useless for being able to find your phone.  I have an iphone with security enabled.  Perhaps it works on an android?<br /><br />Another application advertised is sounding an alarm on your phone when your luggage or wallet walks away by 100 feet.  Again, this only works if the app on your phone is activated, but it seems to go off even if the phone is in the off screen position.  However, I found this feature to be unreliable.  Sitting in frontof the TV, the alarm would go off several times even though my device was stationary and I was stationary.  At times I could get the alarm to activate when leaving the device behind in the house.  At other times, the alarm would not activate.<br /><br />In conclusion, the idea behind this device is good.  However, I found the functionality to be more problematic than useful, and feel that I wasted approximately $90 on the purchase of the 3 devices.  I very much regret the purchase.",16620.0

I own three bags two of them are the two wheel bags and one is the new 4 wheeled bag.  The model number I purchased is DOMESTIC CARRY-ON EXPANDABLE SPINNER U122CXSP.  The problem with this bag is the wheels, pushing it on a smooth floor at the airport is like pushing a shopping cart with bad wheels, it does not stay in a straight line and is all over the place.  Pushing it on a carpeted surface is very difficult to move, you have to resort to tilting it to a two wheeled position.  The worst part is when you transition from one surface to another;  for example on a moving walkway to a carpeted airport floor or an escalator to any floor.  The wheels do not adapt and the suitcase can just stop rolling, not a pleasant experience. I used this bag and cannot return it, I understand that.  I simply hope two events happen. First I hope B&R clearly gets the message, this bag has a  design flaw.  Second, I hope I save someone else from purchasing this bag until the design flaw is resolved.  If you are only interested in a two wheel bag B&R is durable, reliable and has a great warranty and a good repair policy.  If you are considering one of the new four wheeled bags, stay away from this bag and their new bags. Remember once you use it, you cannot return it.<br /><br />I also wrote to B&R customer service about this bag and the wheel design.  This is a line from the reply.  &#34;The wheels on your bag turn 360 degrees and require a tight hold on the bag to direct it on different surface&#34;",16616.0

I own three of their suitcases including the latest design with 4 wheels which is the bag I am calling a failure.  This is model U122CXSP- Domestic Carry On Expandable Spinner.  The problems I experienced with this bag are listed below and I advise anyone who is interested in this bag to not purchase it until  B&R figures out how to change the wheels.  Check it out in the store with no weight it seems perfectly fine.  Take it on your first trip with some weight and you will experience the same dissatisfaction I did and it will be too late to return the bag.<br /><br /> In an environment with a vinyl or non carpeted floor the bag wheels like a bad shopping cart, never staying in a straight line.  Add a low carpet which is in many airports or a texture floor and you need to resort to using the bag as a two wheeled bag which defeats the purpose of purchasing a 4 wheel spinner.  Special attention needs to be paid to using the bag when going from a moving sidewalk or a escalator to a carpeted or textured floor, the bag just simply stops rolling causing a hazardous situation.  I used this bag for the first time on a trip from PHL to BNA (Philadelphia to Nashville) when I arrived home in PHL I saw a Tumi store.  I took a similar size Tumi bag from the store for comparison and added the weight of my laptop bag to it.  I was on a carpeted floor, I can’t say the Tumi was freewheeling but it was steady and much easier to move.  Now I need to decide what to do with the UC122CXSP, Bags and Baggage will not take it back  and I understand that.  My options are to use the guaranteed return option with my American Express card and only receive $300.00.  Sell it on Ebay, most likely for less or keep sending it back to B&R as defective to see if they get the message. Even if they do, designing new wheels and replacing them will take time once they finally admit they have a design problem.",16615.0

At several points during my trip I had to push it diagonally because it wouldn't turn at all, and in airports you just have to keep going, especially when you have 3 large bags and a plane to catch.  Each time it would eventually get stuck and stop moving that direction (guess the wheels finally turned??) so I'd have to keep nudging it to see which way it wanted to be pushed so I could keep moving.

I bought this bag right before my 15-day Europe trip.and my despise for this bag piled up as the days went on.<br />The bag's wheels does not allow simply pushing the bag to move it.

That becomes horrible when we had to walk for a long time to get between hotels, transportation and different sites. My shoulders felt like falling off after days of doing this.<br />Not only that, the bag also has to be held at a certain angle or it would crash into my feet and flip over. This is the worst part of it. I would be crossing street and it would sometimes flip over in traffic or knock into someone behind me. Simply horrible. To top it off, it's not very easy to re-flip the bag!<br />And since I was already on the trip, I had no choice to return it and had to lug the thing around Europe for all of 15 days.<br />I expected more from a bag that I paid $96 for.

This luggage made my whole house smell terrible, and the odor caused my eyes to start watering.  The stench is unrelated to the suitcase color, as the odor comes largely from the black handle and other black plastic parts that are common to all luggage colors.<br /><br />Avoid this product at all cost.  I can't believe people gave this five stars.  Yes, it is inexpensive and lightweight.  But do you want to expose yourself and, if you have them, your kids (which is who I bought this for) to toxic substances?  Not worth it.<br /><br />Details:<br /><br />As soon as I opened the box, I noticed a nasty and overpowering odor coming from the box.  The smell got stronger as soon as the plastic was removed from the luggage.  I then went to pick the luggage up by the black handle.  I could immediately feel a tacky oily substance on my hands.  It smelled like gasoline/kerosene.  I was unable to wash the odor from my hands.<br /><br />I let the suitcase sit open for a few hours in the house.  The odor began to fill the entire first floor of the house and was overpowering.  My eyes began to tear up.  At that point, I had enough.  I put the luggage back in the plastic, sealed it.  Then put in the box and plan to return (hopefully they will take it back; I was so disgusted by this luggage I wrote this review first).<br /><br />If it can't be returned, it's going in the trash.<br /><br />I strongly urge people to stay away from this.  As many other reviewers noted--the smell doesn't quickly go away.  I'm not interested in serving as a guinea pig for this companies toxic product.",16588.0

I tried airing them out in my building's courtyard and even put a dryer sheet with lavender oil inside of each case, but the awful smell never left.  Even after my trip to Italy, the scent was so bad that I had to return them. All of my clothes inside of the case reeked when I wore them and even my hands would smell like the plastic when I touched the outside. I've never smelled anything like it - my entire apartment was so thick with it that I was worried about the off-gases poisoning my children. Seriously, if yours smells, return it immediately, because nothing in nature could have caused this. It has to be toxic.  It's really disappointing, because I loved the color (mine were orange - perhaps that's the only color that stinks?), they are really lightweight and the wheels are good. However, after its 1st trip, the zipper on my big case was missing when I took it off of the luggage carousel and the teeth misaligned - after one trip - so apparently the zips are really flimsy.

The top inside retainer that should hold stuff in place while packing, broke off after about a year, but I could deal with that. Sooo...I ordered a second one to replace the broken one. Sadly, it was already broken right out of the box! The straps in the bottom half are anchored to the inside of the case with self-tapping screws. One of the screws broke free due to lack of plastic where the the screw taps into the case. Basically...just shoddy workmanship. That's why I am giving it one star.

Convinced that it passed the test, I took it with me for my 3-week trip to Rome.<br />COMPLETE FAIL.<br />Positive: the safety hooking of the zipper pulls is very safe. The cut-proof metal-imbedded fabric was never tested. The outside pockets were good for a water bottle and other low-value items.<br />FAIL: the X straps are a failed design. I really gave this bag a try. You can't get the bag easily off and on, other than treating it like a t-shirt. You cannot easily access it without removing it. The strap clips are very secure - so much so that with their inaccessible positioning around one's back (when worn) one cannot easily unhook them for removal of the pack. Wearing it on the front is not good. Rearranging the straps so that they hang like a normal backpack results in shoulder strain, and the bag hangs a bit too low.<br />I recommend not buying this until pacsafe addresses the design flaws, though I suspect nothing short of a completely new design is required.",16586.0

Once I took the bag out of the pouch, I was really disturbed to discover that someone else's return slip had inadvertently been included, complete with that person's name, address and phone number.<br /><br />The bag is really large, and I daresay one can fit an inordinate amount of material in it...whether one can lift it once it's packed is probably another story.  Unfortunately, the carrying strap was missing and the inside looked fairly distressed and made me wonder whether all of the wrinkly areas would eventually crack and become even more unsightly.  I did manage to fold it back up and zip it into a nice package (which is when I realized it hadn't been when I took it out) and I really like that there are three pockets, but I think this is much too large for a petite person such as myself to handle easily once it is packed.

I think this Buddy Bag will be very useful for someone who has a need to tote around fairly large items or a large quantity of material but I think one will need a fair amount of muscle power to move it once it's fully packed! (there is a standard sheet of paper in some of the photos for size comparison)<br /><br />Update 6/28/15  I returned this product immediately, and when I checked Tracking, it showed that it arrived and was signed for at the dock.  That was 3 weeks ago.  I am still waiting for my refund.  I was already suspicious that I had been sent a used bag since it was so rumpled and the strap was missing and someone else's return paperwork was in the package, but now I can't even get my refund.

It indeed was very functional for travel, and that part remains true if you are looking for a one time use suitcase.  The suitcase obviously became dirty in spots from a trip to the West Coast.  There were two transfers of the luggage one going and one on the return, so not excessive handling.  While cleaning it what just looked like dirt, was actually torn fabric along the handle channel.  On closer inspection there was two tears on each side of the channel, one on each side, roughly two inches each.  It is obvious that there is a design flaw in the handle channel design, not sufficient protection, and or just inferior fabric.  We contacted Amazon and the Seller, both transactions were handled responsively.  I was advised to contact Samsonite and that is where things went down hill. There solution is to take the suitcase for evaluation to their nearest store, 50 miles for me, and they will make a judgement if it is covered under warranty.  Well a suitcase should not deteriorate to such degree after one use, and a second trip would no doubt fully compromise the entire handle channel, and thus the contents.  Not sure if I will invest in a 100 mile round trip to get an evaluation, but please be forewarned save yourself from a hassle and a one use suitcase, just do not buy it.",16578.0

I'd prefer the belt buckle coming loose over the bottom clasp as to fix it as it calls a lot more attention to you while you're fixing it. I fixed this by melting the edge of the nylon, making it too thick to pass through that bottom clasp. Now it works as intended....no more embarrassing belt blowouts (I'm a size 38ish, I am by no means stress testing the belt beyond typical use).<br /><br />If you do melt the edge, make sure you do it while the belt is fed through the bottom clasp as the zipper makes it impossible to thread the belt through the other end.",16577.0

After using this product for a few years now, I am baffled it's reviews have remained high. So due to the lack of dissenting views, I feel compelled to write my experience.<br /><br />1st, they claim to be food grade silicone. This may be true, however I & most people I'm guessing are not using them for food condiments, but for bathroom products. I used them for shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, lotion, facewash, dishsoap & laundry soap. This appears to be the manufacturers main intent also as their labeling wheel on the tubes has those similar options (i.e. their is no premade label for ketchup on their label wheel). I like to have a bathroom &#34;go bag&#34; that can be grabbed & packed that has all necessary contents filled & ready. This is not possible with Humangear Gotoobs due to the material interacting with the contents. I noticed several odd interactions.<br />1. Unused products will change consistency after only short periods of time. Many common products, i.e. shampoo / conditioner / bodywash became very watery or runny within a month or two of being in the container and well before their expiration. Strangely other products in the same category had the opposite affect of becoming very thick & unusable. I've never had my containers affect their contents like this before. They have been stored in the same room as the full size bottles in the same conditions, yet the original bottles contents remained unchanged.<br />2. Unused products will empty themselves. This is not due to settling or evaporation. I would fill containers completely, then in a month or two they would be half to 2/3 empty. The lids, to their credit, have a solid seal. The contents are not evaporating. They seem to be getting absorbed if thats possible.<br /><br />2nd, the cost of these is sky high. The 5 pack of all three sizes together cost me nearly $150. Basically about $10/bottle. By anyones standards this is outrageous for empty travel containers that by many measures are worse than the disposable travel bottles. For that cost Humangear can afford to do some quality control testing for longevity with various common products its intended to be used for.<br /><br />3rd, the silicone is also very clingy or sticky to the touch, especially when several of the bottles are in the same bathroom bag together. So the problem arises that when you go to grab a bottle it does not want to be removed without bringing all its neighboring bottles with it. Grabbing one sometimes results in 2 or 3 bottles clinging together & falling out. Way too much friction. This has caused 5 of my bottles lids to break on their 1st fall in the shower. There goes $50. This makes for an unpleasant experience as you have to hold the other bottles down while pulling the 1 out that you actually want.<br /><br />4th, the shape & weight is also a disservice. Most 3oz bottles of disposables or reusables of other brands take up far less space (about half) in my bathroom bag. Way too bulky for their capacities. They are also considerably heavier than other bottles which may or may not be a concern depending on your needs. For me backpacking with a bad back, every ounce counts.<br /><br />5th, the label wheel is hard to read as it is white text on white background. They could have used some contrasting color. Otherwise a good & innovative idea that could avoid using a permanent marker on expensive containers.<br /><br />So, what's their to like about these containers that would justify their worth or existence? Well, the wide mouth is great. Makes filling them easy, even with thicker products like lotion, which you will have to do often as the products won't keep long in the materials they used to manufacture these containers. Also, the silicone makes it easy to squeeze your product out, but has that ever really been a problem?<br /><br />Another positive is that the lids have good seals, this was the initial reason for looking into getting these travel bottles. I live in Colorado in the moutains and many of my weekend getaways would require a lot of altitude change, up & down the passes. When I arrived at my destination I would find many of my travel bottles had exploded in the bag, requiring a cleanup many times in places with limited facilities to do so. This positive is somewhat negated by the lids being no more durable than many disposables as they didn't survive their 1st drop in the shower. Unacceptable at this price point.<br /><br />So, all in all, it is hard to believe I spent that kind of money on such a product. As a careful shopper who does his research before purchasing, it is rare to find a product that seems this good and turns out this bad. Also, can't believe it's star rating is nearly that high. Really makes me question the integrity & independence of Amazon's review controls. I rarely take time to review, but this product was too egregious to neglect as I would feel really bad if someone else made the mistake I did on this product. It seems they need to use higher quality materials, more rigorous quality control testing, a less bulky design with less parts (4 parts to every bottle), and charge 1/2 to 1/3 of their current asking price (is there a world silicone shortage, really?). For the cost, they should last a lifetime. I'm already down 1/3 or 5 out of 15 of my bottles from breaking under infrequent use.<br /><br />I still need bottles that don't explode with small pressure changes and many cheap bottles do. I recently went and purchased some Sea to Summit 3oz travel bottles that claim to have leak proof lids. They do seem sturdy, especially the lids. Time will tell. They were half the cost, about $5/ea, and that was with concentrated product in it. I didn't particularly like, want or need their product, so I dumped it out and put my own in. So, I paid $5/ea for their empty bottles essentially. They are not clingy & are much more slender for the same capacity, but are lacking the wide mouth. Still didn't have trouble refilling them though. I am not concerned these new bottles will have strange interactions with contents like the silicone Humangear bottles did even though these are new because, well every other plastic shampoo bottle in the world has always been fine & I doubt these will be any different. So far I'm very happy going back to heavy duty plastic. All of the above issues seem to be resolved. I just wish their was a widemouth version.

They do create unique products, so far just not very good or useful ones, nor do they constitute a good value. I initially thought the 3oz would be my favorite / most used. After 3 years of owning these, I can say the 1.25oz are my most used, then the 2oz. The 3oz are my least favorite as they bulge out making them not fit well into small spaces. The smaller two sizes are pretty much a uniform width from top to bottom.<br /><br />If considering these bottles, the Humangear bottles do claim to be dishwasher safe.

Hope this has been helpful. Good luck & happy travels.in Colorado in the moutains and many of my weekend getaways would require a lot of altitude change, up & down the passes. When I arrived at my destination I would find many of my travel bottles had exploded in the bag, requiring a cleanup many times in places with limited facilities to do so. This positive is somewhat negated by the lids being no more durable than many disposables as they didn't survive their 1st drop in the shower. Unacceptable at this price point.  So, all in all, it is hard to believe I spent that kind of money on such a product. As a careful shopper who does his research before purchasing, it is rare to find a product that seems this good and turns out this bad. Also, can't believe it's star rating is nearly that high. Really makes me question the integrity & independence of Amazon's review controls. I rarely take time to review, but this product was too egregious to neglect as I would feel really bad if someone else made the mistake I did on this product. It seems they need to use higher quality materials, more rigorous quality control testing, a less bulky design with less parts (4 parts to every bottle), and charge 1/2 to 1/3 of their current asking price (is there a world silicone shortage, really?). For the cost, they should last a lifetime. I'm already down 1/3 or 5 out of 15 of my bottles from breaking under infrequent use.  I still need bottles that don't explode with small pressure changes and many cheap bottles do. I recently went and purchased some Sea to Summit 3oz travel bottles that claim to have leak proof lids. They do seem sturdy, especially the lids. Time will tell. They were half the cost, about $5/ea, and that was with concentrated product in it. I didn't particularly like, want or need their product, so I dumped it out and put my own in. So, I paid $5/ea for their empty bottles essentially. They are not clingy & are much more slender for the same capacity, but are lacking the wide mouth. Still didn't have trouble refillingthem though. I am not concerned these new bottles will have strange interactions with contents like the silicone Humangear bottles did even though these are new because, well every other plastic shampoo bottle in the world has always been fine & I doubt these will be any different. So far I'm very happy going back to heavy duty plastic. All of the above issues seem to be resolved. I just wish their was a widemouth version.

This review was driven by disappointment.<br /><br />I purchased this umbrella last summer and have really only needed to use it 4 - 5 times on the walk to my office. At first it seemed well constructed and compact in its closed form relative to the nice size it had when it was opened. However, the last time I used it about a month ago, one of the wire connectors that seem intended to align the arms detached, resulting in one of the arms trying to open in the opposite direction from what it is supposed to. Then this morning when I opened it, another of the wire connectors detached and half of the umbrella opened in the opposite direction, more like a bird bath than an umbrella. There was a light rain and no wind at all, so this was strictly a mechanical failure. I cannot reconnect the wires, which means I essentially received 4 or 5 uses out of an umbrella for which I paid $60. It seems Tumi is becoming &#34;high end&#34; only in price. Based on my experience, this umbrella has proved itself to be premium priced junk.<br /><br />This is particularly sad because Tumi used to market solid, dependable products and was able to charge premium prices because people could depend on what they received for their money.

Why it's a full $10 more on Amazon.com escapes me, especially with no storefront costs!!<br /><br />Aside from the inflated online price I don't like this product, judged by its two main functions: compression & organization.  I use and enjoy several Eagle Creek products, but this compression set misses the mark.  Its compression is far less than a stuff sack, for example, with the supposed tradeoff of organization—i.e. not everything is in one compartment.  HOWEVER, the organization is lacking due to its too small size.  I am not able to fit any category into these small bags, e.g. tops, bottoms, clean, dirty, etc.  I prefer the Clean Dirty cube offered by the same company, which is much larger and more durable.  It has two-sides for clean and dirty clothes with the dirty side made of waterproof material and clean side made of breathable mesh.  Ingenious!  I bought and used this 2-item Specter set and it was useless... it neither fit all my clean or dirty clothes OR all my tops or bottoms.  I ended up mixing items to whatever fit in each cube, which was NOT good organization.  By the way, all my trips are short, business trips so I'm not talking about some extended vacation!<br /><br />In addition, I got a rip after one trip!  I returned mine immediately and thankfully, the Container Store took them.  Eagle Creek's Pack-It system comes in two fabric types: the regular nylon fabric and the ultra-lightweight &#34;Specter&#34; ripstop nylon fabric.  I do not recommend the Specter fabric due to its far less durable nature.  The regular fabric is lightweight enough.<br /><br />Rather, consider the Clean Dirty cube in both large and small sizes.",16565.0

Also, you literally cannot wear it with anything lighter than dark khaki otherwise it will stain your clothes. Totally serious on this.  I've tried a bunch of different methods to &#34;seal&#34; the color in until I realized its not the dye, its the leather particulate being deposited on my clothes.<br /><br />Its also pretty big.",16550.0

Instantly Spot Your Luggage On The Carousel - Spot It Secure It -",Luggage,1,9,11,N,Y,One Trip Strap,"Having had a strap purchased at Amazon for another piece of luggage that has lasted for years from national to international travel, I decided to buy a new strap for another piece of luggage, mostly to make luggage easier to identify.  When this strap arrived, I noticed that the snap in place buckle seemed thinner than the older strap from a different vendor, so took some extra caution by placing it under  a handle and making sure the buckle wasn't in a position to catch easily on other luggage.  The strap was snug and with the same tension used on our other strap.  At the end of our first cross country trip using this strap, the strap was missing.  I am assuming an employee with the airline may have grabbed the luggage by the strap and the buckle broke and the strap came off, or the strap caught on something, or who knows why but the strap was lost.  The luggage was fine with no evidence of abuse.  Conclusion, most likely the belt failed, likely the buckle broke or failed to hold.  &#34;Premium,&#34;. I think not.",16550.0

Terrible Quality control.,"I bought this rollaboard about 3 weeks before a long trip where I needed to carry on my luggage.  Once I arrived to the airport for the first outing with the bag, I went to take something out of the larger outside pocket, and the zipper slide slid right off the end of the zipper.  I noticed that the seam where that end of the zipper is connected to the bag had all the stitching come out, exposing the internal guts of the bag, and exposing the open end of the zipper, which wasnt connected together at the end, which allowed the zipper slider to come right out!!!  So this bag didnt even make it onto its first flight before it failed.  I couldnt go home and swap out my bag at this point. So I had to do some surgery to get the zipper back together, and baby it for my 4 week international journey.  By the time I get home, the amazon return window has expired.  I have tried to contact TravelPro via the email submission form on their support website, but I have not gotten an answer yet.  So I guess their customer service is no better than their bags.

Absurdly overpriced.,"I've owned backpacks ranging from a $5 Nike cinch sack to an $325 Osprey Aether 85L and over a dozen backpacks in between from technical brands like Marmot, Eagle Creek, REI, Eastern Mountain Sports, Black Diamond, Gregory, Pacsafe, Mountainsmith, and CaseLogic.  I use them for everything from hydration for road running and trail running, mountain biking, camping and hiking in national parks, and one bag travel though Europe (3x) and India.  When it comes to shopping for backpacks, I tend to know more about the brands and technology than even the sales staff.<br /><br />Briggs & Riley generally has a very good reputation online for their backpacks, which made me excited to get this one.  Unfortunately when I opened the plastic bag I was supremely disappointed.  Honestly, this is backpack is just one step in quality and engineering away from those found at department stores.  Any backpack from The North Face (which has become a fashion backpack brand and no longer a technical brand since the early 2000s) is heads and tails superior to this Briggs & Riley bag.  If I had to choose comparable brands, I would say this is along side school backpacks made by Nike and Adidas.  It is essentially a &#34;fashion backpack&#34;.<br /><br />This Briggs & Riley backpack uses material that is run-of-the-mill and not Cordura, Nylon ripstop or any other lightweight durable fabric.  The zippers are big and beefy, but don't feel like they can take abuse.  The main pocket opening is small and makes accessing items at the bottom very difficult.  The front pocket is about 1/3 the size of the front of the backpack and does not have enough room or padding for a tablet.  Both size pockets do not fit anything larger than the smallest 12oz drinking water bottles and because there is no cinching material, the bottles will easily fall out. If I paid $145 for this, I would be very upset.  The only thing going for this backpack in my opinion is the large interior volume and the padded laptop sleeve - which can be found in backpacks costing much less.<br /><br />Here's my advice.  If you want a high quality backpack, research the following brands and pick what you like.  Any bag you pick from these will be more comfortable, of higher quality and better designed.  Most of these brands have excellent warranties, sometimes lifetime. Osprey and Black Diamond are the most durable and technically intelligent.  Marmot, Gregory, REI, Eastern Mountain Sports (EMS), Mountainsmith and Eagle Creek are excellent brands and nearly as good as Osprey and Black Diamond.  CaseLogic is a very good computer backpack brand.  The North Face is no longer a technical brand but their backpacks are still better built than most.  In these brands you can find a better pack at 1/2 the price of this Briggs & Riley.e - which can be found in backpacks costing much less.<br /><br />Here's my advice.

The overbuild is very good and the interior nicely designed, but the locks is where they failed with this model, at least with the 25&#34; and above category.  The material these chose for the locks is cheap plastic variant of some sort, and had these used a more structurally sound material then this would have been 5 stars.<br /><br />I purchased this for my 15yr old daughter who was going on multi-country Europe trip for 10 days and decided hard-case was the way to go. We currently have luggage (carry-on) by Lojel, so naturally I looked to them again for the bigger size needed for her trip as we're happy with the quality.  I narrowed it down to the Lojel Kosmos or the Horizon, and I'm now really sorry I didn't go with the Horizon.  The 3 locks had me sold too, but the Kosmos looks impressive on paper specs swayed me.<br /><br />Upon receiving the Kosmos, the very first thing that got my attention was how flimsy (cheap plastic) the locks were and how unsecure it held both  sides together, i.e., when locked there was visible separation on the corner nearest the wheels  Upon seeing this I had a gut feeling this was a poor choice and failure was possibly imminent, but my daughter was leaving in 2 days.<br /><br />Well on her return trip is when failure occurred. Quite honestly it almost looks as if when opening the luggage the cheap plastic snapped.  Sure it comes with a wonderful 10yr warranty, but whats the use when they will likely place the blame of the Airline handling and not there poor material choice & latch design.<br /><br />What a freaking waste of $400!

My husband and I decided to purchase a complete luggage set as a Christmas gift to ourselves. We were interested in what we considered the best traveling brand, Samsonite. Perhaps it is partially our fault for going with a cheaper option. However, when we found this deal on Amazon, we were more than thrilled, thinking it was some sort of holiday special. After one trip overseas, the large suitcase ripped at the seams leaving the metal frame sticking out on the side near the handle.  When researching which item we would purchase, we did read the reviews and saw several that mentioned their suitcases handles had broken, but we didn't think there were enough complaints to pass up this deal. The smaller suitcase has been sufficient so far, though it hasn't with gone any international flights just yet, just three domestic flights. Nonetheless, we are disappointed in the quality of this product, and will not be purchasing from Samsonite again.

Since I was going on a trip in a week and loved everything else about them, I did everything to rid the smell. Febreze 3 times, Lysol,  Clorox wipes,  setting out in the sun for a full day, and even scrubbing with a warm solution of Oxi Clean and water.  This was over the course of 7 days but NOTHING worked. I scrubbed so hard the paint on the fabric came off. I can't return them now and my husband agreed to use the carryon on our trip (we used our old large suitcase over the brand new one because it was THAT bad). He had to seal his clothes in a plastic pillow holder with a zipper to protect them from this smell which permeated to the clothes - I even tested that theory.

It looks like they cut it too small by a few inches.<br /><br />Attached are a couple of photos showing the “hammock” issue.  When the Coke can is pressed all the way to the bottom toward the left, the other won’t stay near the top.  In the other photo, when the Coke can is pushed up right to the top, the one at the bottom is pulled upward.  It is like losing 10% of the interior space.  Unzipping the liner doesn’t fix the issue, just makes loosing things inside it a problem.<br /><br />Note also that this case does not have a zipper expansion.  If you are not flying, that’s still not an option.<br /><br />So if the interior size is not an issue, this case is a pretty good value.  It would be even better if the Travelpro folks cut the liner to the right size.  Unfortunately for me, space is a deal-breaker.  I cut 4 stars for the lack of attention to this detail.  I’m having to send this one back.",16504.0

I'm a student and have only used the backpack to carry books to and from school (i.e. I've never gone hiking with it or handled it roughly), which speaks to how low the quality must be for it to be falling apart from such light use.

I have a 22 inch hard case spinner from Brookstone and was looking for something with a front pouch, and a little lighter in weight.  The first time I ordered it, they sent the 28 inch by mistake.  I had to return and reorder the 22 inch, and it is MUCH smaller than my other.  Upon measuring it, it is 22 inches from the *wheel to the tip of the handle*, which they don't mention when ordering.  When I measured the inside packing area, it is a meager 12&#34; x 15&#34;!  My other one gives me 15&#34;x20&#34; packing space. The zipper that opens the main packing area is also cut in so it doesn't open to a flat packing area.  The zipper is located by the first front pouch, not the side.  So you lose flat packing ability.  Very disappointed, not in the luggage necessarily; it may work for others just wanting an overnight bag, but it certainly would not work for even a weekend bag with 3 changes of clothes, shoes and whatever else.  It does roll very easily and spins great...when empty.  When full, it tips over a lot when I tried to roll it along.  Basically, I had to either pull it behind me on 2 wheels or roll it while I lifted it a bit.

Tumi - eveolutionary is fine - revolutionary can backfire (and it did).","My wife is a professional photographer.  She has traveled the world over for the last decade solely with Tumi luggage.  The vapor line has been fantastic to her.  I was going with her on a trip to Kenya and decided to get some new luggage.  We bought 6 pieces.  We are returning all 6.  Reasons from least important to most:<br /><br />1.  The lock is upside down.  They didn't even bother to swap the dials.  To open it you must find a way to read upside down from right to left inverted in dimly lit rooms.  If you open the case while the lock is upright, all of your stuff will fall out.  This may not seem like much on the surface, but every Tumi bag up until this point has the lock on the correct side.  They could have even just flipped the numbers on the dials and that would have been fine, but on a 1K piece of luggage they chose not to.<br />2.  After a single trip, the luggage looks worse than our 10-year-old other Tumi pieces.  It looks 15 years old!<br />3.  There is no lock on the front pouch.  They took up a TON of real estate with the front pouch and then gave you no way to protect the contents.  You must purchase and remember to bring a secondary lock.<br />4.  The zippers do not match.  You do not know which ones you will get.  One is flawed (a flattish-looking one).  I believe that they had an &#34;oh crap&#34; moment and changed the zipper mid-production.  If you get the flat one, then it is very easy to latch one side incorrectly, making the other side not fit in.<br />5.  This is the big one.  The new front pouch is not only a point of weakness, but a point of failure.  Loading a mid-sized case with 70 lbs of heavy goods while flat seems great.  If the entire case is hard, like the vapor line, then nothing shifts when you turn it vertical.  With the new pouch, when you go to the wheels, all of the goods press out the pouch and fall down to where the wheels are, causing the bag to get a &#34;beer belly&#34; and turn round.  From there, the contents never settle back to the original packed position again.  They sort of get wedged into that round section, causing the luggage to become unwieldy.<br /><br />Tumi - your QA needs to be reprimanded, to say the least.",16482.0

It is well over 22 inches tall, not including the handle! The 14 inch width is about right, and if you don't try to stuff it, it will meet the 9 inch depth too. The height, however, left me concerned. I know the airlines only spot check bag sizes today, but I will not risk getting a gate check and bag check fees for a carry-on that should meet the 22 x 14 x 9 inch domestic airline requirements (for Delta, United, American and US Air today).    So, back this bag goes. Maybe someday Travelpro will include wheels and handles in their advertised dimensions, instead of just the case portion.  Or even better, design their 22-inch luggage to fit just right into a 22 x 14 x 9 inch box!    I compared this bag with the similar Travelpro Crew 10 21-inch Spinner.  They are just a little different.  Neither one meets the 22 x 14 x 9 inch domestic airline requirement - both are over the 22-inch height rule.    One thing I did notice was that the Crew 10 only had their \\""Limited Lifetime Warranty\\"" while the Platinum Magna had their \\""Worry-Free Warranty\\"" (better).  Both cover lifetime materials and workmanship, but the Platinum Magnum also covers abuse by common carriers.  Apparently if the airlines break off a wheel it is covered.  Unfortunately both warranties say you have to ship it back to Travelpro at your expense for repair.  However, I've also found depending on where you live, there may be a repair shop (shoes and luggage, etc.) that will handle the claim for you without shipping.  Nice!  (Check the Travelpro website to see if there is some place near you).    Both the Platinum Magna and Crew 10 series use nylon outer fabric, much more abrasion resistant than their lower series (Marquis, Nuance, Maxlite, etc.) which only use polyester.  Probably makes a difference for the million-miler travelers.  Cosmetically the corners and wear points won't get that fuzzed up look.    I unzipped the inner liner to see how things were made from the inside.  It was nice to see that this piece was assembled mainly with screws instead of rivets.  That makes it a little stronger, and much easier to repair if things come loose or break.  Might even be something you could repair yourself if you aren't near a repair shop.    I was really looking for a spinner style bag, but ended up buying the Travelpro Platinum Magna 20-inch Business Plus Rollaboard.  It just barely fits into a 22 x 14 x 9 inch box.  Will have to review that piece upon return from my first trip.

I received a damaged bag; it has a deep hole in the leather on the front of the bag. I was very surprised that it passed quality control. The seller sent me another one, which is also damaged and worse than the first one. This time both corners of the leather strap closure are frayed and the inside zipper is broken. Now I know these bags are not going through quality checks. I thought they would have checked the second one since it was a replacement for a damaged one. Apparently, the seller is sending their damaged bags to overseas customers hoping they will get away with it. I contacted the seller again, who was not only rude, but refused to send me a bag that is not damaged.

There was a card inside asking<br />that I contact you before leaving a negative comment. Although there is<br />nothing you can do about my concern, I thought I would be polite and honor<br />your request.<br /><br />The Pocket Vault is well made and cleverly designed with its multiple<br />compartments. As I fully expected (from reading other reviewers' comments)<br />the stored contents are not immediately accessible as this sits inside my<br />pants. That is okay since my prime reason for purchasing your product was<br />only to disguise the fact that I have valuables hidden on my person.<br />Unfortunately, it doesn't accomplish this with its grey belt loop. All of my<br />belts (as I suspect many other people's) are brown leather. The grey belt<br />loop on the Pocket Vault contrasts sharply with my belts advertising that I<br />have something hidden inside my pants.<br /><br />If you ever manufacturer a Pocket Vault with a brown or black belt loop, I<br />will consider repurchasing one. For now, I will be returning your product to<br />Amazon for a refund.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Steve<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Dear Steve,<br /><br />After reading your e-mail I had to stop and pause for a minute and really think about what you said. I asked myself, &#34;Wait why didn't we make the loop black&#34;?  And to be honest I think it was a major oversight. We were concentrating so hard on the other functions we let this one slip.  I'm talking to our engineers now to produce a black loop over the gray.<br /><br />Thank you so much for your input, we really appreciate it.<br /><br />John",16477.0

If you want to check the veracity of this story about Skyway going out of business and re-opening using the same name, without any Skyway honoring warranties, I invite you to call Sharon, the head of their warranty claim dept and ask her about Skyway warranties of a few years ago versus today and if Skyway did indeed change hands.  Sharon can be reached at her direct number at (425) 207-1912.  This is her direct number, so it goes right to her without you having to go thru a ridiculous answering system.  So, before buying, ask her about Skyway warranties and if she really can honor your long-term warranty, or if Skyway will not sellout again and leave you with an overpriced piece of luggage with a useless warranty.  Be smart, and find out who is standing behind your product before you hand over your hard earned money.<br /><br />A warranty is no good if the company you buy from simply changes hands but uses the same name to avoid standing behind their products.<br /><br />I just wanted to warn others so they can make the right decision on what brand luggage they buy.

The first one I owned did the same thing, thankfully they are covered under the warranty from the store.  I attributed the first busted seam on me possibly trying to pack too much stuff in and the seam being under too much pressure.  On the second one I deliberately kept it light yet it still busted.  Really disappointed, especially since I had each one for only a month or two before they came apart, and I barely traveled during that time.  The wear on each of these bags was extremely light.<br /><br />I will be taking this bag back to the store today and staying away from it from now on.

The changes make it completely unsatisfactory for me.  They have removed the interior zippered bill compartment.  This was a critical feature because I travel internationally.  The zippered bill compartment gave me a place to carry US Dollars separate, secured and out of sight from local currency.  Additionally the plastic window is now gone from the ID compartment.  This gave added protection for the additional ID's that I tucked under my US issued drivers license.  The new design is poor engineering in that it puts added stress on your ID that was relieved by the plastic window making them more prone to stress cracking.  Lastly, the wallet size, material and stitching has all been reduced making it dramatically more flimsy.

I also see why some complained about the single hidden clasp being hard to access, but that was not a deal-breaker for me.<br /><br />My reason for return is that with no zipper over the top compartment of the bag, water can EASILY get in.  The picture is deceptive and it is true what others said about the top lip of the bag folding down.  When I close the bag, there is a big gap on each side that is not covered by the flap.

It looks and feels great, and I like the fact that it has a holder for a phone on the strap. BUT I got this bag assuming that I would be able to swing it to the front of my body and access the main compartment without removing the bag. I was wrong. If you look carefully, you'll notice that on one side you can access a water bottle compartment and on the other side you can access the main compartment and the flat compartment (tablet, magazine, etc.). No problem so far. The problem is that the bag is designed so that it straps over your right shoulder, and when you swing it around to the front of your body (under your left arm pit), the water bottle compartment is facing up, while the main compartment and tablet compartment are facing down. If you open the main compartment in this position, everything inside will just fall out... very poor design. IF you were able to unclip the strap at the bottom and clip it to the other side and strap it over your left shoulder (an option on many other sling bags), I would have given this bag 5 stars +, as that is the only flaw I see, but a very big one.

It came on Dec 23  in a box and just put a bow on the box.  He opened it Christmas morning never took it out of the box and plastic bag it came in. Filled it with his carry on items on Dec 26th at 3:00am to catch a 6 am flight to Orlando with our 4 grandchildren. He was pulled by the TSA as his new bag came up for EXPLOSIVES! They pulled him apart, searching him and everything he had. They swabbed the bag and every part of the zipped and seams came up positive! W\e almost missed our flight and our 4 grandchildren were terrified and crying as they thought their PAPA was going to jail!<br />So I'm asking AMAZON where did this bag come from and what warehouse was it in before it was shipped. The TSA has asked us to let them know also.<br />The bag was great minus the EXPLOSIVE RESIDUE of course!<br /><br />Headline for your review<br /><br />View tips and guidelines<br /><br /> Add a photo<br /><br />  Submit<br /> Uploading a video?

The technical issue is that the rear wheels slightly stick out from the back of the suitcase, and then the plastic on the back of the suitcase where the handle inserts into the bag also sticks out from the back of the suitcase.

Is just the right size, has plenty of room with all my necessities, I always find that I have a little more room to squeeze one more item in. I'm kind of a heavy packer - everything but the kitchen sink type, so this works for me, and the size is not even so big or bulky. The 7 extra pockets on the sides really come in handy - just to give you some idea of the sized, I use the lower pocket on top of the bag for a small paperback book - fits perfectly and doesn't take away from the size of the main compartment. In the top side pocket I stick in my mini umbrella to have &#34;just in case&#34;. Would definitely by another if I needed, but hopefully will last at least 5-7 years, like the last bag I owned. Will definitely recommend to friends and family. Price was also very reasonable. and I loved the color I got! Wheels are sturdy, strong - goes over sidewalk bumps easily, and relatively quiet on city-paved sidewalks.  UPDATE! 7/30/15 I originally purchased this duffel bag in October, and used it appoximately once a month from then until April for weekend trips, travelling mostly by car/bus. By April, the seam where the main zipper attaches to the bag started ripping. Unfortunately, it was already past Amazon's return policy to return or replace the product. I have to say that I'm very dissappointed. I have frequent need for it's use now, as in the summer I go away every weekend,  but I cannot use it because the rip got wider. I tried sewing it up, but that didn't help as the stiches came out easily. I want to mention that I have used this bag normally, to the fullest, but was careful not to overdo it. I don't know if this is a fluke or what, but I have the same bag in 26&#34; and its holding up well. I will try to get it replaced via Olympia's one year warranty, but I will need to pay S&H to return it.  Update 2- Sept. 2015. Almost a year later after I bought this luggage. My opinion has changed dramatically. I had purchased the26 inch pics of this luggage after I was satisfied with this piece... now I have changed my opinion about this olympia low cost luggage line. Unfortunately, neither piece lasted frequent use, normal wear and tear on city streets and coach bus travel.

Upon opening the box all I could smell was vinyl. Anyone that knows leather, knows what leather smells like, whether its a belt, wallet, purse, jacket or what ever, leather has a wonderful distinct smell. This bag smells of vinyl and only vinyl.<br /><br />Perhaps I was expecting more, a product that was really nice quality of real genuine leather. The picture showed a smooth soft leather. This bag is hard, really shinny and smells only of vinyl, inside & out. But for what I paid, I should have known better. It is true, you get what you pay for. Although if I wanted a vinyl bag, I probably could have bought one at my local department store for not much over $12.<br /><br />Upon really close inspection, it appears it could be some form of pressed & formed leather, almost like a piece of cheap beef jerky. However, I wanted a shaving kit bag to match my leather luggage, so this bag is going back. I have already ordered another bag that should be really fine leather, of course it cost almost twice what I paid for this, but I'm getting what I want.<br /><br />Products sold in this country that are referred to as being made of leather are required to be labeled, stamped or embossed somewhere on the product indicating as such.

Then I noticed something alarming.  As I was examining the case to determine if it had any sort of model name on it, I removed my HP Slate 7 to discover this thing HAS DAMAGED MY TABLET. The tension clip idea is awesome in theory.  I purchased this because my sister uses it with a Nook HD, and it certainly looked like the perfect system for the job.  Now I'm seriously dissatisfied.  The clips actually dented the plastic and caused the finish to wear off of the back cover.  I asked around (even on Amazon questions) and have a confirm that this case causes damage to plastic bezels on some tablets.  It damaged my sister's Nook and my Slate.  I'm posting pictures of the type of damage it causes, just to show users what I'm talking about.  If you have an extremely rugged tablet, or maybe you don't too much care about this sort of thing, then maybe it's no big deal to you.  It doesn't affect the device's functionality at all, so at least there's that.  In the long run, I consider my tablet a mediocre device at best, and it was given to me by someone terribly fed up with it, so for it to have some cosmetic damage is just par for the course.

I even returned the first through Amazon, and tried again.  Same issue.  What the heck!!!  Seriously, if you buy this bag, I GUARANTEE you, the zipper WILL break.  Don't buy this bag.  Again, it looks super sharp, but zipper breaks after just a few uses.  This is how I've been carrying mine around lately (see photo).  How sad for something that costs $130. ------ Incredible bag.  I went with the Caramel canvas, and it's sharp!  I've gotten quite a bit of comments, almost too many for just a gym bag, and I've had it for about a week.  Slightly more expensive than the other Herschel Novel bags, but absolutely worth it!  The craftsmanship is exponentially better than what you'd get from the standard Novel.  I know, because I bought this canvas bag and a standard one and compared them side by side.  It's very clear that a normal Novel would be damaged, and probably even considered useless, after only a few months (thin nylon, weak zipper, plastic fastenings); however, this one...it'll last a lifetime.  Think, durable canvas; wide brass zipper; and brass fasteners.  Perfect for use as a weekender, overnight, or gym bag.  I use it as a gym bag and, at first, was worried about the size.  Then, it arrived at my house, I packed it up, and it's the perfect size!  Never worry about having to cram everything in the bag, or not having enough space for everything.  This is especially true if you're going to the gym before work and are packing your work clothes.  Everything fits nicely and comes out wrinkle free.  The separate shoe compartment is awesome...never worry about getting nasty shoe gunk on your clothes.  Can also double as a separate compartment for wet or extra sweaty clothes, swimsuits, etc.  Internal mesh pocket is nice for keys, wallets, deodorant, etc.  Only drawback is that there are no other small internal or external pockets.  Would be nice to see a small pocket on the outside for quick access to those keys and wallet I mentioned before.  Otherwise, fantastic bag.  If you're in the market for a Heschel gym or overnight bag, skip the standard Novel line, and invest a few more bucks for this!

Spinner Suiter Trolley,Luggage,1,10,11,N,N,Disposable Luggage,"Purchased two of these suitcases for travel across USA and Europe.<br /><br />Good news:  Ultra light weight,very high internal capacity compared to external size, easy to pack and close.  Once of the most efficient and easy to pack suitcases I've ever owned.<br /><br />Bad news:  very, very fragile....  On one trip, my suitcase developed a long crack extending from one spinner wheel up along edge of case and is a complete loss.  Luckily the internal fabric liner prevented the contents from spilling out.  It was never loaded to over 45 lbs and I never carried another bag on top of it.  A second suitcase (belonging to my significant other)  is on its way out, too.  This second case is often loaded to 50 lbs and is wheeled with a second bag on top of it.  One spinner wheel now routinely collapses into the case which is beginning to crack.  Both cases lasted a couple of trips, then failed.<br /><br />The case is so light and efficient because the polycarbonate shell is very thin and light.  It does not weigh much, nor does it occupy much space.  But in my experience, the shell is also way too thin (and hence too weak) to withstand the stress of routine baggage handling by airlines and simple stresses of users wheeling it around terminals.  I now think of it as disposable luggage - it may last one or two trips, but like thin high density plastic supermarket shopping bags, it really will not work well for repeated use.<br /><br />Propaganda about the case being made of the same material as fighter aircraft windshields is misleading - it implies strength.  But no matter how strong the material, if there is too little of it, the end product is weakness.  And I've found this case to be very weak, indeed.  If you have this case already or are going to buy it - I suggest that you inspect it after each trip leg for cracking and buckling, or risk losing the contents.",16398.0

This suitcase worked great for 1 year - I really do love it's size, weight, compartment options, and the ease of pushing or pulling the bag alongside me. For a year I took it on many trips and always carried it on without problems. I recently took a trip with my 10 month old so we decided to check our bags to give us a little less to handle on the plane. When I got my back from the carousel, one of the wheels had completely broken off. The plastic was shattered with no hope of repairing, even if I could find the missing wheel.

I was looking to replace a well warn heavy duty carry-on suitcase that had served me well over the years… but was soiled… and I was tired of the old fashioned two wheel model. This tissue thin spinner model right out of the box had the following issues and characteristics. When I pressed the handle that releases the trolley… it did not seamlessly expand… you had to jiggle it and pull it… and it felt like it was one yank (which would have been the second yank of its career) from falling apart or jamming. When I tried to wheel it in multiple directions it barely moved… the wheels did not pivot and rotate fluently… if it did at all. Despite the listed dimensions it had a much smaller capacity than my old one which was approximately the same size. Extremely disappointing was the diminutive size of the two front pouches. Again to compare it to my old bag… in one of the pouches on the front of my old bag I could easily fit a men’s toiletry bag in it… along with a full see-through bag that is required to go through security at the airport. This new bag could not even fit my toiletry bag.<br /><br />As disappointed as I was I decided to give it one last try as far as maneuverability was concerned. I tried to quickly wheel it back and forth and change directions in a hallway in my house… the results were that I felt I had **THE-WORLD’S-LIGHTEST-SHERMAN-TANK-WITH-NO-WHEELS**.  Fifteen minutes after opening it… I was on the phone with Amazon getting a return authorization. It is currently on my front steps waiting for UPS to pick it up.,16386.0

The pockets on the side are too big, won't stay closed with tiny piece of velcro (zippers would be better)  and things just fall out, pretty much useless.

On a recent trip, both of them lost one wheel each.  Thankfully, the wheels came off pretty much at the same time while I was rolling them into the hotel room so therefore was able to retrieve the wheel and axles.  Once in the hotel room, I opened the liner and noticed that the axles are held on only by a simple nut inside.  Not even a lock washer or lock nut.  Granted, the axles are square shafts with bearing wheels, so the nuts are not load bearing, but if you roll these things over rough pavement, the vibrations will loosen the nuts.  However after spending over $1800.00 on both pieces, I expect the wheels to stay on.  This is a serious issue with the current revision of these bags.<br />Nevertheless, I found the nut in both bags and was able to spin them on and tighten them with a multi-tool, however upon my return flight, again, the same wheels just fell off because the vibration of rolling them had spun off the nuts.  Once I figure out the size of the axle bolt, I will purchase some nylock nuts to retain the wheels.  However I'm in Afghanistan so these things are hard to find.<br />Tumi, if you read this, a simple 20 cent fix by replacing the simple nuts with lock-nuts is all it takes to make these bags bomb-proof.  Come on, this is not cheap luggage.  Fix it.",16374.0

At All.,"This backpack lasted less than 76 days before developing 2 majors tears around the side seams, each several inches in length.  I purchased this for my son to use for school near the end of the previous school year.  He got 43 days of acceptable use, then the backpack was put aside for summer vacation.  He resumed using it for school in the Fall, as the new school year began, and in less than 2 months, the backpack has unacceptably large holes.  I am extremely frustrated.  I had ordered this backpack after my son found that non-American made backpacks were not at all durable for school.  He insisted that we search for a good quality American made one.  Only seeing this online, but knowing it was American made, we made this purchase.  As soon as it arrived, I was appalled at how thin and flimsy it appeared.  I started a review right away, but instead of posting it immediately, I sent my concerns to the company.  I was assured in their reply that their products are so long lasting that they are passed down from generation to generation.  So, I thought it would be fair to give this a chance and see how it held up for normal (not excessive at all) school use.  I now have my answer.  It doesn't.  Of course, any warranty is expired as summer vacation interrupted continuous use of the backpack.  (I  just knew that would happen......)  Lesson learned.  Go to KMart, buy a cheap backpack and take their 1 year coverage plan.

Probably $1500-$2000 worth of cases but I was getting tired of having to replace cheaper cases every 6-9 months.  The build quality is suspect - both nylon cases lost their Tumi logos within a few weeks (one case on the first trip) - its due to the fact they are glued on rather than riveted and they catch in the overhead bin of planes.  I do around 50000-75000 miles a year so not really a road warrior.  I doubt these cases will last for more than a year or so (they have only been in the baggage hold a handful of times).  One case has square wheels or a bearing problem.  The backpack has poorly design zipper tags - 3 have broken off after 5 months - the metal is too thin at the loop that connects to the zipper.  Otherwise they are well designed cases.<br />Customer service is appalling - I wanted to get new zippers for the backpack and new wheels for one case plus see if they could replace the logos (all within 6 months of purchase).  I was told by 3 separate Tumi airport stores I would have to return the case to a depot to be checked and then MAYBE they would replace the wheels etc. They should have a return to Tumi service in each store and give you a new case if they are under warranty.<br />Tried by email and got quoted $30 for zippers so bought 5 for $10 off amazon...<br />Not what I expect for this price and supposed warrenty - I will not be buying ANYTHING from Tumi again.,16365.0

But another downside.  On the back of the bag there is a strip of leather like materials that runs up the back.  I think it's decorative. It serves no purpose.  Imagine lifting up your bag to put it in the overhead with wheels out as you are supposed to.  Then it gets stuck on the lip of the overhead storage and rips.  Duh. What a stupid design.  Just another reason to hate is bag.    I wanted to love this bag.  I really did.  But unfortunately there is a serious design flaw.  Pros: Light weight.  Seriously light weight and it rolls really well.  Almost as if it wants to roll on its own. Color: Its nice to have a bag that isn't black like all the others. Handles: It has nice sturdy padded handles on the bottom, top and side.  Cons: People have mentioned it being tippy.  It is not only tippy.  It topples.  I am a road warrior traveling several flights per week.  I went with Travelpro after much deliberation because of the name.  This bag does not cut it.  I truly believe it is a design flaw.  If you look at the wheel base they are too close together.  When the wheels point out it creates a wider base and it is more stable.  So each time you park it you have to roll it backward slightly and wait with your breath held to see if it will fall over or not.  If you even consider putting a rolling computer bag on top you might as well start working out with weights so you can constantly be lifting your bag back up after it has fallen over.  There are pros to this bag.  But the major con outweighs it for me.  Oh and a final note.  You CAN NOT return once you have used.  So if you worry about it being tippy even with nothing on top, You can not use it even once to try it.  They will not take a return or an exchange.  Too much of a risk I think.  I wish I had know that before.  if you see someone at the airport with their bag laying on the floor next to them, its probably me.",16363.0

The top clear plastic layer on the case scrapes off super easily, making it looked ragged - it was badly scraped up from shipping before it was even opened.<br /><br />Here is the detail about picking the best bag for frequent business travel:<br /><br />My business travel requirements and employer-mandated travel booking system will often force me to book a sequence of one-way tickets with very little time between the connecting flights.<br />I can't check bags through to my destination as they are discrete flights, and I don't have enough layover time to retrieve bags between flights.<br />This means that I have to travel entirely carry-on, and it may be for weeks of international travel.<br />Gate checking for regional flights, is unavoidable, and not as problematic as putting bags in regular baggage.<br /><br />Lately, I've been seeing domestic carriers, like United, and international carriers, like Luftwaffe (I mean Lufthansa), become more demanding about bag sizes.<br />For decades, I have carried soft roller bags that have been about 22&#34;x16&#34;x12&#34;, and I have always had them fit well in the overhead bins of larger planes.<br />A bag that size takes up the full vertical height of an overhead bin, but leaving a couple of inches free above a bag is just inefficient use of the space.<br />United and a couple of others have picked the unreasonably small dimensions of 14&#34; width and 9&#34; depth.<br />In my opinion, that is just a blatant revenue-grabbing tactic designed to force more bags into costly checked baggage.<br />I've had my latest bag rejected twice recently by Lufthansa for being too tall, and it was only by 1/2&#34; of extra height from a bag handle that made the bag unfit.<br /><br />Here is what I need:<br /> - Black rollerbag style, but don't care if it is swivel or fixed caster wheels<br /> - 21&#34;x14&#34;x9&#34;, including wheels handles and anything else<br /> - Maximum compartment space within those dimensions for clothing, without laptop-specific space, as I need all the room I can get for clothes<br /> - Hardsided, because soft bags balloon out more, have pockets that stick out, and weigh much more<br /> - Expandable, so I can put more in when I know I'm on a less-restrictive flight<br /> - Polycarbonate, as it is stronger per weight than ABS<br /> - Less than many hundreds of dollars in cost, but reasonable in quality<br /><br />After looking everywhere, I was amazed at how tough it is to find a bag like this!<br />I had to compromise on the pure polycarbonate requirement, as it seems that even when the vendor says it is pure polycarbonate, it almost always has ABS in combination with it.<br />One of the problems is that most vendors now only offer swivel wheels (spinners) on their hardsided units, and those wheels add almost two inches to the height.<br />The other huge problem is that it is difficult to find accurate dimensions on bags anywhere.<br />I tried to rely on luggagepros.com because they are one of the only sites that shows heights with an indication of it being with or without wheels.<br /><br />The contenders were:<br />A) ZERO Halliburton ZERO Whirl Polycarbonate 4 Wheel 19&#34;, 19.0&#34;

models with spinner wheels would be nearly 22&#34; including the wheels, and maybe even taller if their handles stick out, so those would not work.<br />That left only the Zero Haliburton units, one of the SwissGear units, and the Olympia Titan.<br /><br />I had strong hopes for the Olympia Titan, as it was the the only expandable, was closer the the maximum size, and it was the most affordable.<br />I called luggagepros.com to confirm their published dimensions, and they stood by their numbers.<br />Unfortunately, I found two large issues when I received the unit.<br /><br />The first issue with the Olympia Titan concerns its quality.<br />The unit came wrapped in a plastic bag, which was placed inside of a cardboard box.<br />When I pulled it out, it appeared to have long scratches on the front and back, and looked like it had already been slid onto its sides in travel use.<br />Closer examination revealed that the polycarbonate/ABS shell has a top layer of clear plastic, almost as if it had been shrink wrapped.<br />Evidently, this top layer is not very durable, and just the shipping of the bag in its pouch and box had worn away the top layer at many points of contact.<br />When the clear top layer starts coming loose, it looks frayed and ragged, and can be peeled back further from where it is broken open.<br />This is very unsightly, and although I know that every bag will get scratched quickly in use, I would not expect to receive it looking very used, and the peeling of the top layer is likely to make it look more ragged than a bag without the layer.<br /><br />The second issue with the Olympic Titan was an even larger deal-breaker for me.<br />The bag measured almost 22&#34; in height, including the stiff top handle, and very close to 10&#34; in depth.<br />Apparently, even luggagepro.com can't be trusted for accurate measurements.<br />I will be returning the Olympia Titan shortly.<br /><br />My next purchase will be a bit of a DIY modification effort.<br />I will get one of the less-expensive 20&#34; models with the right width and depth, and then modify the bag to incorporate detachable swivel wheels.<br />This way I will have maximum compartment height, and will be able to pull off and pocket the wheels if asked to prove that the bag fits into a 20&#34; or 21&#34; luggage sizer box.<br />For anyone interested in this modification, I plan to take off the original swivel casters, install sockets on the inside of the case (e.g. broad brimmed top hat caster sockets for 7/16-inch caster stem), and buy standard pull-out stem casters that fit those sockets (e.g. 2&#34; in-line skate wheel swivel caster with 7/16-inch grip ring stem).<br />An alternative would be to mount two non-swivel wheels with a recessed mount, as that might only add an inch to the height, but it might be a more difficult modification.<br /><br />I might as well mention the my strategy for a second carry-on bag, especially because many size limits for a second bag will not even allow for a 17&#34; laptop to fit (some have a 10&#34; width limit, and 17&#34; laptops are 10.3&#34;).<br />For my second carry-on bag, I have decided to ditch my trusty laptop bag, and put the laptop into the larger rollerbag (in the middle, protected by clothes).<br />The second bag will be a &#34;packable&#34; backpack, into which I will stuff a DIY &#34;luggage vest&#34;.<br />A thin packable nylon backpack is sturdy enough, as it won't ever be checked, and won't have to carry to much weight.<br />The vest will be like a plain nylon wind-breaker with arms removed, and will have a number of large packing cubes attached by velcro around the inside.<br />My smaller items (e.g. socks, under-ware, under-shirts, small electronics, etc.) will go into the packing cubes.<br />For flights that allow two carry-on, I will pack the vest-with-packing-cubes into the packable backpack, and carry on the backpack.<br />For flights that allow only one carry-on, I will pull the vest out of the backpack, pack the backpack into a packing cube in the vest, wear the vest on to the plane (underneath my usual wind-breaker), and once on to the plan, put the vest back into the backpack.<br />There are no restrictions on the contents of your coat, and there are even &#34;luggage coats&#34;

We paid for one day delivery to make sure we got it in time. Unfortunately we had an issue with the zipper on one of the exterior pockets of the larger bag-it was sewed crooked so we cannot close the pocket making it useless. I contacted Amazon and we are able to use the luggage and then return it to them for a refund when we get home since we are out of time to have a replacement sent to us. Based on other reviews talking about the zippers I'm kind of kicking myself that I didn't heed their warning. Oh, and random other thing to point out. In the description of the luggage is says \\""System nests together for storage, largest unit measures 17 3/4 x 10 3/4 x 28\\"", 10 lbs., 12 ozs. total weight\\"". That's a big, fat lie. The 3 nested pieces weigh over 27 pounds. Obviously the 10 lb, 12 ozs. is for just the large bag and maybe I should have guessed that but the wording of \\""total weight\\"" sure did make it seem like it was for all 3 bags. That total weight helped in our decision making process as well, so had we known they weighed the same as other bags out there then we wouldn't have used that in our decision.<br /><br />Even though we're having to return this item I'm giving it a 2 star rating because of the ease of returning it since we purchased it from Amazon directly and because the pocket that is effected will not make the bag unusable for this trip. When we get home we'll return these and continue the search.<br /><br />***EDIT*** We just got back from our trip and as stated we had to use this luggage set because we did not have time to get anything else. Initially we were planning to just get a replacement set of this same luggage when we got home but after using them we are just doing a straight return. The wheels on this luggage do not function as one would hope. Having 4 wheels you should be able to maneuver the luggage in any direction needed yet the way the wheels are designed they have to be facing a certain way in order to roll, it almost makes it like a shopping cart with a dysfunctional wheel. It was incredibly frustrating to try to move them on all 4 wheels so we ended up just pulling them behind us like a 2 wheeled bag which completely defeats the purpose of buying 4 wheeled bags! I've dropped my rating down to one star because after using them, even if the zipper was not faulty, we would have returned them out of pure frustration and dissatisfaction!to roll, it almost makes it like a shopping cart with a dysfunctional wheel.

This bag fit easily in the box when it came to length and width. However, it was about 2 inches taller (height) than the sizing box's maximum height of 17 inches. This is despite the fact that the bag is advertized in this ad as being 16 inches or 17 inches tall (BOTH ARE NOT TRUE). This bag's height including the wheels is actually 19 inches. TSA said I had to check one of them because the trolley tote was too tall. Since the trolley tote had my laptop and frozen breast milk (expressed for my 7 month old), I couldn't check it. So I had to check the 20 inch spinner, which again, fit perfectly in the sizing box. Very disappointed and had to pay $25!  Wish I could return it and get my money back and buy a smaller tote.

The fashion duffel bags that are sold via eBags do NOT contain an interior mesh pocket inside of them, nor do they contain black insets.    I originally ordered this bag on September 11th, 2014. I received the wrong bag. The bag I received did not contain black insets or a mesh pocket inside, and it has a strange odor. While I filed for a return here on Amazon.com, I also wanted to contact eBags directly on their website to let them know that they have the wrong items pictured, and to prevent other customers from purchasing the bags if they were not going to receive the exact ones in the photo. Both representatives were very helpful. The representative I spoke to on eBags.com told me that Olympia made some sort of change with the bag's design and that he would let their team know so they could change the photos on the site. He advised me to go ahead and file for a return (which I had already done).    I ended up ordering the bag in a different print (leopard) on September 29th hoping that this print was still designed like the one in the photo and hadn't been changed by the manufacturer. I just received the bag today and of course, it is the wrong bag. This one does not have black insets either or an interior mesh pocket.    I am highly disappointed and bothered that they still haven't changed the photos or description here on Amazon or on the eBags.com website. I am not satisfied with the bag's design, or with the odor, or the interior of the bag. The interior looks very cheap and flimsy.    The only reason I am keeping this bag is because my younger sister is a sweetheart and appreciates any and everything that I buy her, no matter how horribly it is made, and I just don't feel like dropping it off at UPS and waiting for another refund.    eBags, I hope you all will update your information to prevent other customers from receiving the wrong item.",16349.0

I don't get it.,"Seriously, I saw the positive reviews and although I wasn't thrilled w/ the designs available, I was kind of intrigued and went ahead and bought it, thinking it might be stylish, different, cool, etc.  Sorry, the wallet is a joke.  I ordered the black one.  It's actually see through if you look at it closely.  The craftsmanship on mine was flawed, part of the sail fabric seemed wrinkled and the edges on it lacked crispness in my opinion.  The wallet doesn't stay closed.  Sure, it will close if you apply pressure to it or it's in your pocket, but it basically opens up on its own because it's just cloth with some sort of glossy covering and doesn't have enough weight to it if you flip it on its back.  This is very lame.    One of the reasons I thought I would like it is because it's supposed to be light and/or thin.  My feeling is it's not much lighter or thinner than the leather wallet I've had for a number of years, and not nearly as stylish.  It has a couple of pockets that are wide and loose, not separated into a greater number of smaller slots for cards like many leather wallets have.  This is likely not a good design as I imagine cards will fall out easily unless you have enough and the non-staggered card slots will make the wallet fatter.    All in all, I thought the wallet was ugly and a joke.  I don't care if the thing \\""floats\\"" or is \\""stronger than steel.\\""  If it stayed closed maybe it wouldn't take on water and/or dump out all the cards, but because it doesn't stay closed, the floating claim is pretty much useless.  It was pretty useless in the first place.  I wasn't planning on floating my wallet, unless maybe I'm a sailor or something.  Even then, it's not water tight and doesn't even stay closed.  It's stronger than steel?  How so?  So what?  I doubt I can fry eggs on it like a skillet.    Seriously, I'm not sure why I'm so passionate about bashing this wallet, but it truly doesn't deserve it's high rating or warrant a price higher than maybe $10.  I don't mean to bash whoever made it in Maine (probably some crunchy hippies), but it just sucks.  I immediately returned it without removing any of its tags.",16349.0

It amazes me that a company like Tumi could have so little understanding of how this is supposed to work. I always buy luggage with this in mind and this has been both the most expensive and least effective.<br />2. The inside has one large loose pocket which again goes the full length of the bag, but has no stiffness or structure so when putting a laptop or document into the bag, there's a 50/50 chance at any time you will be pushing against this divider.<br />Like all Tumi bags, this is well-made from a structural point of view, and if you are looking for a bag to put your gym gear in, maybe this is fine. If however you want this to be part of an efficient Tumi system, this bag will frustrate you every time you use it. For the prices that Tumi charges and the expertise they claim to have, I am at a loss as to how this one ever got off the drawing board.",16341.0

It was extremely uncomfortable as a female. the straps don't have padding all the way down, and are thinner than expected. The bag really is as small as it looks. It might be okay for a carry on, that only has your laptop, charger, and magazines but not much else. the laptop part doesn't zip and unfold as easily, pretty, or flawlessly as the picture, or reviews say. If you unzip it with the laptop inside the laptop almost falls away from the rest of the bag. Not good. Also, the laptop sleeve is the zipper part that is on your back. I don't know about other people but that is hard feeling against my back.  It WAS NOT worth the $140. I think that price is strictly for the guard protection, but the pocket is so tiny, and in such a bad spot, I know I wouldn't even use it. I was very excited about the straps that go across the waist and chest. As a female who is 5'7 it did not hit in the right places, at all. The hip does not adjust up or down like the chest straps do.<br />With a laptop in the bag, even though it has its own pocket, there wasn't room for ANYTHING more than my 1 inch binder. That was it, nothing else could fitOne last thing, the zippers are &#34;safety&#34; zippers, which really means that they have fabric covering the zippers. Yes, it does make it harder for a thief to get your stuff, but it also makes it way harder and annoying to try and get your own stuff out of the bag without having to deal with folding back the stupid fabric along the entire bag, and then folding it back! They are metal so that's good, I guess.  If the straps would have worked the way I was expecting, and the laptop zipper wasn't so clumsy, I probably would have kept it.

TERRIBLE PRODUCT. it was not even within 5 pounds. We got to the airport and every bags was 5 to 8 pounds lighter than the scale. Thank the gods in that direction. But flying foreign we had space for for 30 pounds more to take to our other home. If It had been the other way we would have had to buy a suitcase because of a box embargo and pay $150 for it. I called their customer service that is as bad as the scale. I also wrote them. I told them I was in Latin America. Their website lets you type what you want to say and then tells you after your limited on characters and not when you have run out. They sent my email a return label for use in the US. Bad product, bad customer service and at this point I must assume they have gone so far down hill all the stuff even luggage is crap.",16306.0

The piece was enticing because it was rather large and the price was fairly low.  It also was a roller bag that I thought would be helpful getting to and from the airport, cruise ship, and our accommodations in Rome.  Looking back now, I did see some negative reviews and it is my fault I didn't give them the consideration they deserved.  Most of the reviews were positive though.<br /><br />The bag arrived in fine condition and did well until a couple of days after we arrived in Italy.  Three days into the trip, I attempted to open the front compartment for the first time, and the zipper was broken, as if not threaded properly.  The &#34;teeth&#34; would close, but then come apart on their own, creating a useless &#34;flap&#34; on the front of the suitcase.  A few nights later, still on the cruise, I picked the bag up and put it on the bed so I could unzip the main compartment to get something out.  I looked down and was surprised to see that one of the 4 wheels was still sitting in the middle of the room.  Knowing how much trip I had left, I wishfully though I'd be able to snap or screw it back into place.  But on closer look, what appeared to be a plastic-like material that had joined the wheel to the frame of the suitcase had cracked.  For the remainder of the trip, I was forced to attempt to balance and roll on three wheels and eventually just started dragging it behind me as the corner scraped  the ground.  By the time I got home and tried to return it, Amazon informed me the return period had expired while I was abroad.<br /><br />I regret not spending a little more time (and very possibly more money) to get something that would last.I do not recommend buying this luggage.",16292.0

I did not over pack either of the bags, yet halfway through the trip the fabric between the secondary and main zipper ripped almost all the way along the vertical portion of the luggage.  Furthermore, on the trip back, several of the metal pieces popped out to reveal holes in the fabric on the back; I am certain further use will cause those holes to turn into tears, rendering the luggage useless.  By the time I returned I discovered the refund window was closed and there doesn't seem to be any way to get in touch with anyone about it.  It's ludicrous that on its first use this luggage should fall to pieces.  It doesn't seem that this is always the case considering the other reviews; I would really just like the large luggage to be replaced.",16292.0

I bought this bag in a pinch because of the good reviews and good price. I don't expect this to perform like a $200 bag, but I did expect the zippers to stay on. Well, I guess I expected too much because all but 2 of the zippers fell off on my last trip. It is terribly difficult to open this suitcase without zippers. You have to drag the nub slowly. And as you do that, it stabs underneath your fingernail. Not a fun experience. So, after I got home last time, as I unpacked, I had to find a pair of pliers and clamp down the remaining zippers. I considered putting zip ties on the nubs, but I am too embarrassed to be seen by my colleagues with zip tie luggage. I chose this bright turquoise color to match some existing luggage. That too was a mistake. After the first trip, it came back all black and marked with lines of grease and dirt. I don't want black or blue luggage because everyone else has that. So beware of your color choice. I should have tried scotch guard, but didn't and now it's too late. The one great thing about this bag is that the handle works like a charm every single time. It slides and retracts so easily.  I also had no problem with the gripping handles or interior. The bag itself has a lot of room. I manage to pack 50 pounds in it every time.

It seems to made from good materials.  However, it's got a couple of flaws.  On my very first trip with this bag (literally loaded it up, went to the airport, got off the plane, looked down and one of the front pockets had torn apart from the backpack right at the stitching.  This pocket probably needed to be double stitched, but that said, it wasn't like I had even loaded any weight into the pocket.    Also,if you load your laptop into the laptop pocket, that's cool and everything, but let's say you now use the main pocket for books.  Not a huge problem in any other  bag,  but now, you're putting a lot of stress/load on the zipper between the laptop pocket and the main compartment.  What happens when the zipper fails?  Luckily, this didn't happen to me, But (and I've seen this on other designs), add a couple of webbing straps from the back of laptop pocket (over the zipper) to the main pocket to keep the zipper from having to shoulder the load.  (this one seems obvious and I can't believe the designers missed it).    Side pockets are ok for a waterbottle, but don't put anything else there or it will fall out.    Edit 8/26/2014 Im dropping the rating on this bag to a single star.  The workmanship and return attitude of customer service totally ruins this bag.  Since the initial review, less than a month ago, the should strap has now begun coming torn out at the stitching as well.  Dealing with customer service, seems more like an exercise in 'guilty until proven innocent'.  Not at all akin to the experience I had when I had an issue with my OGIO bag after OVER A YEAR OF USE!  Deeply regret having tried something different in this case.",16282.0

There is a photo of a woman holding the bag with the shoulder strap which gives you an idea of how large this bag should be. I was stunned to find that it was MUCH SMALLER than depicted. I ordered this bag thinking it would be a &#34;large&#34; or &#34;extra large&#34; size. If I had to size it, I'd give it a MEDIUM at best. The photo is inaccurate and deceptive.<br /><br />Two, the SMELL inside this bag is atrocious. And I don't mean that something crawled inside the bag and died. I mean that whatever this bag is made of smells heavily of chemicals. The outside of the bag material seems fabric-y and the inside seems plastic-y. There is no label stating what it is made of. HOWEVER, there is a label on the inside of the bag stating that it is manufactured from materials  known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects. What?? I assume that it's lead but it could be a whole host of other toxic ingredients.<br /><br />I actually put the bag through the washing machine twice (once with detergent, once without) and hung it outside for a day to see if the smell would lessen. It didn't. I'm not sure what I could use this bag for. I'm afraid of my clothes/shoes/etc picking up the strong chemical scent, and I'm afraid of handling whatever materials it was made from.

Better luggage tags have a space to insert a piece of paper with the information on it, so that if you change your address or phone number, you can update the tag with your new information.<br /><br />It seems that the manufacturer did no product testing whatsoever on this.

While light weight, within 2 trips (Delta), the case had a crack in the plastic.  I figured it was a fluke and kept using it.  I taped it up (inside and out) and kept going.  The next trip, the logo tag was riped off so I taped it so it would not tear, then, in January of this year, the stitching on one side started to come loose.  I taped that up and now, on this last trip, the end has a 5&#34; crack in the plastic.  Basically, this case is trashed.

However, less than 4 months later the fatal flaw appeared, the zipper is of very inferior quality.  By way of background, I owned a similar bag and used it for 15 years,  weekly cloths carrier ,  probably 100 trips in private aircraft and 60 commercial flights including Europe, Hawaii,  etc.  It was being replaced because the bottom was simply wearing out.      The new bag looked and felt good .  However the zipper failed after 5 months and zero flights.  If it happened on a commercial flight I would never see the contents again.  I can not tell what happened to the zipper, it zips but the slightest pressure causes the teeth to disengage.  I think the answer is that the zipper is simply far below what is required.  I'll see what it would cost to replace it but most likely the bag goes in the dumpster.             INITIAL REVIEW     Very well made bag.  Stitching and details were nice.    It replaces one I have used for 15 years on a weekly basis.  Highly recommended",16271.0

I was hoping for a great traveling experience since samsonite has a good reputation.  I can honestly say that it was the worst experience ever.

It was a constant battle to keep it upright and moving. By the end of the trip I just wanted to throw both pieces in the trash.

Zipper – The zipper on this suitcase is not strong enough for a check-on bag. The problem is that since the zipper is in the middle of the suitcase (butterfly design), all of the weight from the contents weighs down on the weak zipper, especially when it is lifted...causing a lot of strain even when loaded normally (40-50lbs). Even though I do not travel that often and do not overstuff my bag, the zipper has split open each time that I do travel, and I worry that the contents will fall out when it appears on the luggage carousel. I do not think that the zipper or wheels are covered by the warranty. I am extremely disappointed by spending $600 on a suitcase that doesn't stay closed and causes me stress worrying about the contents to the point where I can no longer use it. It certainly would have been a better decision to buy the cheapest suitcase and just replace anytime that it has damage...than to buy a super expensive suitcase that did not even survive one trip. If you do end up buying this suitcase, I highly recommend using straps to help secure it closed and put less strain on the zipper.<br />2. Only One Handle – There are two versions of this suitcase depending on if it is made in Europe or not. One of the two versions does not have a top handle (only a side handle), which makes it very difficult to lift in different ways. I lucked out and was sent the one with two handles...but do not know how to specify this as my carry-on bag only has one handle.<br />3. Difficulty Rolling – When fully loaded (up to normal 50lb weight of check-on suitcases), it is more difficult to roll around than some other suitcases and has to be tilted and rolled on two wheels. The suitcases that travel personnel use (like Travel Pro) where they hang a bag on the outside when loaded to make it seem weightless while rolling around is better (in my opinion) for lugging around heavy suitcases.<br />4. Butterfly construction does not allow you to open suitcase on normal luggage stand as it is too big.<br /><br />(Pro: The suitcase itself is very light, and the outside material has been sturdy and waterproof.)<br /><br />Review of the carry-on size:<br />Cons:<br />1. The extendible handle on my suitcase will not extend the whole way as something is jamming it. I assume that a screw or something has broken off inside of it and will find out soon if the warranty will cover this repair.<br />2. Handles – Mine only has a size handle and not a top handle, which makes it very difficult to put in and take out of the overhead compartment. When drivers or bellboys try to help me with this bag, I see them struggle at trying to figure out how to pick it up until they see the side handle, which is not sufficient (in my opinion). This is a serious design flaw.<br />3. Volume – Does not fit as much stuff as a two-wheeled bag.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Fits in the overhead compartment of even smaller planes (as long as you don't stuff it) that normally do not fit rolling suitcases).<br />2. Stylish<br />3. Easy to roll around (on all fours if on smooth floor and tilted if on carpet)...but still easier to roll around the suitcases where you hang a bag off to make it weightless like the airline employees use.<br />4. Waterproof<br />5. Can attach jacket in bungee on the top",16269.0

I measured all around and it was the right dimensions....or so I thought. When we got to the airport the wheels made it so it didn't quite fit in the metal luggage size checker, they stick out a little.<br /><br />First the lady said we would have to pay to check it and it had all my sons expensive electronics in it!!! But since we were running late and started to explained this she just said just go to the customs line with it and hope they don't put it in the size box there because there is no time to check it. If they hadn't let it slide he would have been in trouble he needed his electronics and stuff for school abroad and we couldn't change flights the school was meeting the kids at the airport in Japan and the ticket was non refundable. When my son got on the plane he said the case hardly fit in the overhead ONLY because of the wheels and at one point the overhead popped opened because of the suitcase wheels. The only reason he got it in there was because the other seat passengers were not using the overhead.<br /><br />Its time to come home and now he if afraid to even try again to use that and risk having a problem at the airport if they check the size. What a waste of money and it could have wound up costing over a hundred more for it if we had had to check it not to mention the electronics that could have been stolen in checked luggage.

They have a good deal of space inside and have a zip netting to separate and secure the clothing on the lid, as well as luggage straps on the bottom. These are super light, so it helps keep the weight down.  I have traveled with these twice now, and they do hold up pretty well, except I did get a small crack on the handle but I would expect some wear the way they get tossed around by handlers. The wheels do all right, not super easy but much better to have the option to push it along than drag it behind me. I purchased these to replace my rolling duffel because they kept ripping with each use and was tired of pulling out the duct tape. These are more sturdy and remain light, a great looking option as well! The shape of these fits well in a trunk, one of the reasons why I purchased rolling duffels in the first place... to fit all the luggage for a family of four in the rental car.  These still work well.. The only reason I dropped a star was because the handle cracked.. but overall I would recommend.<br /><br />UPDATE!!!!  While these are well organized and light, they have a MAJOR FLAW.  The plastic pieces that hold the handles on, crack easily and crumble off, thus making the handles useless.  It makes it very difficult to pick up the suitcases.  I used the carry-on bag quite a bit, and hadn't experienced the true wear and tear of the baggage handlers.

Both my husband and I travel a lot for work - mostly international flights to Africa and Asia. We purchased this suitcase as have had some excellent experience with Atlantic in the past and we like the ultra lite aspect of the product.  We have low expectations for luggage when travelling as the baggage handlers are fairly rough but usually a suitcase lasts anywhere from 3-4 years.  We purchased the suitcase through amazon and discovered the following:<br /><br />The first time I took the bag on a trip one of the feet came off the bottom of the bag.  I tried to phone Atlantic as the product was under warranty but hit call center hell and was advised to ship (at my expense) to a repair center where they would ascertain if the case was damaged due to my neglect or eligible for refund or replacement.  After hitting this dead end, I contacted Amazon and received excellent customer care.  I asked for a replacement bag as assumed that this was a fluke - the bag arrived a few days later.  .<br /><br />A couple of weeks later I took the second bag on its first trip.  Upon arrival at location I discovered both zipper sliders were missing from the bag (so the bag was completely open).

I guess hanging it is the only option for it not to behave so floppily, but I don't like hanging this bag because the main/lower compartment then gapes out, threatening to dump that compartment's contents. Moreoever, the hanger itself constantly flops around and gets in the way when I'm trying to open and close the bag.<br /><br />The main compartment has several bottle-shaped pockets, which would be nice except for the fact that the pockets are actually just bottomless slots, so bottles eventually creep down and slip out of them, ending up on the floor or bottom of the bag.

One reason I purchased the bag was because of the supposed &#34;Lifetime Guarantee&#34; the company promised.  On the way to the airport the first time I used the bag, the metal Eagle Creek logo on the front of the bag fell off and was lost.  I assumed that one call would resolve this problem, and a new logo would immediately be in the mail to me.  Unfortunately, this was not my experience,  The customer service rep I spoke to said that I would have to take the bag to UPS (extremely inconvenient!), pay for new packaging since I had thrown away the original box, pay for insurance, pay for postage, and send the bag back to the company to have a new metal logo attached.  Not only would this cost $50 or $60, but I also would have no suitcase for an upcoming trip.  When I asked if the logo could be sent to me so I wouldn't have to return the bag, the rep told me I would have to discuss this with her supervisor, Jose.  Since Jose did not answer his phone, I left a detailed message and my phone number.  Alas, Jose didn't even have the courtesy to return my call.  No wonder Eagle Creek can promise a lifetime guarantee since they realize few people will pay the high fees to return the luggage for repair.

The sign will warn other travelers not to buy Eagle Creek products or to believe the company's customer service promises.",16219.0

If you want to be ecominded, look for vegetable-tanned leather products, or buy used from vintage and thrift clothing stores.    Read up! Do you own search...  23.07.2012 The European Council of Vinyl Manufacturers (ECVM) has issued a statement contesting conclusions by the PVCfreeBloodBag project that PVC blood bags “pose a significant risk to human health.”    The project called last week for blood bags made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) that contain diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) to be phased out in favour of safer alternatives after carrying out a life-cycle assessment of their impact (CW 18 July 2012([...]).    However, the ECVM said that such conclusions contradicted findings by the European Commission’s Scientific Committee on the Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (Scenihr). The committee concluded in 2008 that, while “there is reason for some concern for prematurely born male neonates for which the DEHP exposure may be transiently above the dose inducing reproductive toxicity in animal studies, there is no conclusive scientific evidence that DEHP exposure via medical treatments has harmful effects in humans”.",16219.0

I start thinking and realized it was from my Travelon Anti-theft bag! The handle look like it was build good because inside was a really hard stiff nylon. The stiff nylon that was protruding the end part (handle) of the shoulder bag was causing our big scratches!!! I noticed also that the stitches started coming off. My bag was not that heavy.

I contacted Herschel Supply and went through the process. I was given the option of sending a photo with \\""both shoulder straps cut off and a large incision down the back of the bag\\"" to warrant my backpack in exchange for equivalent credit of $54.99 to only be used in their online store.... yeah I love my Rust colored Settlement, and this color is no longer offered. And they \\""cannot guarantee that you will receive the same bag.\\"" Now I'm left looking for a third party to fix my ordeal at my own expense. Not worth the purchase, nor forking out money for shipments. If you're looking for durability, I suggest JanSport.<br /><br />* This backpack looks durable, classic, stylish, and the color (Rust) is just what I expected. I have a short petite frame, and the size looks great. It's not too big for me. My brother tried it on and he liked it. He is tall 5'11 lean build, and the fit looks perfect on him, but I'm still keeping it. It's mine! Hahaha. I purchased mine from Amazon seller \\""altrec,\\"" and I'm completely satisfied with their service and packaging.<br /><br />Inside the Main Pocket:<br />* Pocket for a 13'-15' inch laptop can fit snuggly.<br />* There is a small media pocket on the side that can fit small devices like an iPhone 3GS.<br />* Interior may differ, mine is exactly as pictured with red/white stripes.<br />* Spacious enough to fit textbooks, notebooks, with laptop included.<br /><br />Inside the Small Pocket:<br />* Simple pocket with a keychain holder snap.<br />* No additional inner pockets included.<br /><br />Exterior:<br />* Near the media pocket that is inside there is a round rubbery black socket outside. I believe it is intended to slip earphones while it is connected to a device.<br />* The zippers look incredibly durable, and classic. Just how I like it. There is no lip bordering the OUTSIDE of the zipper, which I think is fantastic. No one enjoys having to take out a zipper that's stuck on that extra material.<br />* The entire material of the backpack feels durable.<br />* There is minimal leather (a small piece on one shoulder strap, and removable straps on each zipper).<br />* The padding on the shoulder straps feel durable, and most importantly incredibly comfortable.<br /><br />I have no idea how it holds up against machine washing. Suggestions are spot cleaning only. My dog accidentally pissed on my backpack, and I quickly washed the spot with mild soap and warm water, no stains were left nor color fade.",16211.0

After 2 weeks of using it, I've given up! Its gone from 3 stars to 1.  This is my 3rd handbag and it will be my last.  With the cheaper, slippery fabric, this bag does not hold its shape when I carry it, folding into a kind of sloppy U-shaped pouch. The strap is uncomfortable and slides to different lengths on its own. In addition, the main zipper gets stuck about 2 inches from the end every time I open it, and that was the final straw. I have replaced it with the 200 GII Shoulder Bag which I found at REI. It is made of the ballistic nylon & has all the old, sturdy  qualities missing from the new handbag.  It looks so much more professional, and it holds everything I need.<br /><br />I'm not very happy with the changes Pacsafe made to this bag. Overall, I find  the size and convenience very good for my travel purposes. I don't like backpacks and this purse really can carry everything I need: passports, small wallet, glasses, camera, personal grooming items, water, iPad and/or  Kindle or binoculars as needed, etc.  My last handbag lasted about 5 years which I think is excellent considering how much travel it had done. But to my surprise, the metal clasp at the end of the shoulder strap snapped in two---seemed like metal \\""fatigue\\"".  I was still able to fix it to the point of use by reattaching the clasp to another piece---until that one snapped upon arriving at an airport during a business trip. No fun at all.<br />Now to the new version:<br />1.  The old bag was made of ballistic nylon.  The new one is a lesser quality nylon and slippery, as in slides out from under your seat upon flight take off.<br />2.  The new strap is narrower and less stiff or sturdy. I haven't found it as comfortable on my shoulder for some reason, and it too seems more slippery.<br />3.  The old bag had two outside back zippered (security) pockets.  The new bag has one big long zippered pocket which I find makes organization more difficult. Things just mash together.<br />4. Ditto for the inside: there is one large inside pocket in which I can put my iPad or Kindle, but it gaps open because it is fastened by one tab with a snap.  It gets in  the way when I want to get to the main inside body of the purse for my wallet.<br />5.  On the plus side, it still has one smaller zippered inside pocket and it does have sewn down pocket organizers for phone, glasses, pens.  One of those is an RFID safe pocket for passports or credit cards. That point was not really clear on the product description, but is a nice feature. Now I can return the RFID safe wallet I purchased at the same time.<br />The new bag has a 5 year warranty, but I'll still be interested to see how this one holds up vs. my original bag.",16203.0

I would give this a ZERO stars if possible.  I have bought literally hundreds of items from amazon.com in the past, so when I had settled on this TUMI bag (I saw in a shopping Mall), I went home and purchased it through amazon.com for the exact same retail price ($395) I saw it for in the mall. It arrived in good shape, and appeared to be a wise purchase.  However, after 3-4 months of use, it began showing a 'cheaply made' wear sign, having fuzz flittering up around the zipper areas. I ignored that and discounted it at the time. Around the 6 month mark, I had a normal amount in the back (which I used taking to work everyday and traveling frequently like I do), and the right support armstrap (at the bottom) just popped and tore right out exposing the foam (for cushion) they put in the sleeve of the armstrap.  A day or two later, the left armstrap tore just the same.  I am taking it to a registered TUMI repair shop, but (since I live in Beijing, China), I don't know if or how much they will charge me. Even if they don't charge me, that is not the issue.  The point is that if you are going to spend $395 on a backpack, you expect to get many many quality years of use out of it.  I made this investment because with Samsung, and other products, I find them wearing out every 18-24 months and having to spend $125 to $175 to replace. I decided I would go the luxury route this time and have a luxury and quality bag for a minimum of 6-8 years and hopefully 10+....NOT THE CASE.

Looks really ugly when standing!,"I had written the review below the dashed line in the first week. Continuing the analogy I gave at the bottom, I conclude that if you really do not like something, do not buy it with a compromise like I did.<br />After using the bag for over a month, I found that the bag is drooping so much in the front that, you feel it will topple any time (but it doesn't) and that makes it look even uglier. It is a waste of money! Do not buy this item. I strongly feel that this is a fake Chinese bag being sold with a Samsonite sticker. I have used Samsonite for several years and have not seen such a bad design from Samsonite. If this is truly Samsonite and note a fake one, Samsonite/Amazon should return my money even if I have passed 30 days window.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Pros: The Amazon price of $88 is the best available price than all retail stores. This is one of the best rolling backpacks available. The TSA friendly side pocket for laptop is good and the bag can be used as a good overnighter also with a large middle pocket, but it should have had more pockets/separators in the middle section, just in case one wants to put another laptop/tablet. The spinner wheels and handle is good and rugged.<br /><br />Cons: The black fabric outside is good but the inner red color fabric looks ugly. The bag does not look good when standing on 4 wheels, it is drooping in the front, as if you think it can fall down any time (although it doesn't).<br /><br />I can give an analogy. When you look at the resume of a person and you find everything that you are looking for is available, but overall you do not like the personality... you get that kind of a feeling after buying this back. I will not return this bag as it has all what I was looking for, but I do not really feel great carrying this bag.",16197.0

We didn't know how much money she would need, so we over did-it a little figuring we could always take it back.<br />We separated her euros into three areas, the most in what seemed the safest place...the bra stash. I was a bit nervous because the button on this thing seemed pretty &#34;stiff&#34;...hard to close and hard to open. But I thought that would mean it would stay on better, not that it could not be clasped properly!<br />Day one...bra stash failed and came off her bra somewhere in the hotel. BOOM, 100 euro gone! One would hope someone would return it, but things are tough everywhere! I guess someone had a nice bonus. (Why cry about it, the money is gone and there is nothing I can do about it, right?)<br />So I am recommending you don't be as paranoid as me and just buy a money belt and/or an over the shoulder purse. And if you have a feeling the clasps are not working properly, don't use them either! Send them back and get something better!",16193.0

Poor quality.,"I purchased this from Amazon on 3/24/14 for my vacation to Italy.  My husband also bought the Metrosafe for his own use.<br /><br />I had read many positive reviews on the bag, and trusted that it would be ideal for our vacation, having heard many stories of pickpockets in Italy.  The bag would've been wonderful, and indeed was, until the last day of the 9 day trip, when it broke. (This is after less than 14 days total of routine (not rough) use). The  Pacsafe label on the front of the bag (small, metal), popped off suddenly, leaving an unslightly hole in the the fabric/mesh.  I noticed it when strolling along, and, again, there was no undue roughness asked of the bag.  The rectangular Pacsafe metal label is not, as it appears, sewn on to the bag securely, but rather attached via evidently a metal attachment/round bracket to the bag itself.  This bag, now in addition to looking tacky, is not as secure as before, as it has a hole where a thief's utensil/knife could be used to get into the bag, which goes against the point of the bag.  I was exceedingly disappointed, as I was expecting to use this on many international trips, and it is purported to be a long-lasting product.  I considered it an investment, and of course it turned out to not possess the quality it is advertised to have.<br /><br />The plus side is that until the quality issue noted above, I did appreciate the ability to lock the zipper tab to the strap, particularly in crowd public transport situations. The zipper is black (I have the black bag), and in under 2 weeks use the black color does come off the locking mechanism.<br /><br />However, given the poor quality with the label, I am left wondering if I would've been better off with baggalini or another safe-bag company.<br /><br />I have contacted the Pacsafe company via the generic form on their website.  I would like a replacement (if the quality is any better, as, again, I would appreciate a reliable international travel bag), or a refund.  I amunsure how to contact amazon about this, as I spent some time trying to figure out how to do so prior to this post; I cannot do a routine return since the item is (lightly) used.  I did take photos of the defect.<br /><br />I will update if I hear back from the companies.<br /><br />Again, the concept is good, but the execution/quality lacks, or at least it did on my particular bag.

I honestly don't know what they were thinking when they redesigned this product.  The first thing that I used to love about this bag is that it was designed to snugly fit on top of the Briggs and Riley roller travel suitcase (I've had three of those as well).  It was unique motivation to purchase the two together.  Well in their infinite wisdom, the company decided to manufacture the two products so that they don't fit together anymore. The result is that when I'm dashing through the airport, the bag has a tendency to fall off the top of the roller travel suitcase.  It's happened a couple of times when I've been crossing the street as well.  The second thing is that they used to have a very nice little pocket on the side that you could put your pens and a few small nicknacks in.  In an apparent money saving move, they eliminated that pocket.  Instead, they kept the large side pocket which tends to be pretty  useless because after you put your power cord and accessories in the large zip up compartment next to that, the pocket doesn't like for you to put anything in there.  So there is nowhere for me to put my pens, my Verizon 4G card and things like that.  The third thing and this is by far the worst thing about this product is that they did something to the fabric on the inside of the bag where your laptop sits, providing too much of it such that it tends to stick out of the sides of the bag.  The result is that the fabric constantly gets caught in the zipper the encloses the main compartment and it tends to be extremely difficult to get it unstuck leading to a great deal of frustration.<br /><br />Normally I'd just write this off as a poorly designed product and get rid of it.  My disappointed is exacerbated by the fact that previous ones were so good.  It was literally the best laptop bag I've ever had.  Though they provide a lifetime warranty, I've bought new ones because I like to have a nice newer shiny bag.  This new release of the product is just terrible product at a premium price.

But I did find a great EC alternative!,"I don't own this zip organizer although I'd intended to purchase it. I own a previous version I bought 15 years ago right before I moved to Europe for a year. Back then we didn't have those newfangled Euros and we had to organize many different currencies. My original Eagle Creek travel document holder had 2 slots where you could organize currency, a zipper compartment which was big enough to hold currency flat and a zipper space for change. It also had slots for numerous cards, room for a small notepad and pen and additional slots for your plane tickets and passport. This Zip Organizer is an insult to its ancestors. It doesn't have any hidden pockets, I couldn't believe it. There is only one spot  to organize money and no additional interior pockets other then what you see in the image. It's far too limited for a true traveler, especially if you are organizing for multiple family members.<br /><br />Then I found the Eagle Creek Marian Zip Around Wallet. It's everything I've wanted in a travel wallet. It's even the same size as the eagle creek zip organizer. It has tons of pockets, THREE of which ZIP and are big enough to hold flat currency. You can use the partitions to organize documents and receipts and it has room for cards and other incidentals. I threw a pen and a small notebook in mine and frankly I think it's better than the old document organizer I was broken-hearted about replacing. My only complaint is they designed it as a wallet so it doesn't open completely flat. I'm okay with that. If you are a serious traveler and serious about expenses and organization I would buy the Marian Zip Wallet. Even at it's slightly higher price tag it's completely worth the cost.

Customer service folks confused.,"Dear Tumi,<br /><br />Oh why, oh why, oh qhy would you place a picture of a hanger included with the bag on your web page [...] only to not include it?<br />I couldn't find the usual asterisk disclaiming, \\""Hanger sold separately\\"".  Well, the bag retails for $600, and the picture is clearly advertising it.  Was I naive to believe that the TUMI brand would never bait and switch?  I remember seeing this sort of bait and switching about a decade ago when the web commerce was in its infancy.  But I could be naive so I surveyed 10 friends, \\""Hey look at this webpage, the bag costs $600 and the picture shows a hanger.  What do you think?\\""  Well, it turns out that all 10 people are naive just as me.<br /><br />When the bag first arrived, I immediately that the operator forgot to include the hanger.  So I called, the customer service representative was just as confused as I was.  She said, \\""well we include the hangers in some bags\\"" I ask, \\""well, is it included in the alpha 2? She answers \\""No\\"".  So I ask, \\""Can you show me a product where you include the hangers?\\""  She changes her story and says \\""look under the features tab, we say that we include the hanger bracket but not the hanger\\""  So I tell her.  \\""Did you know that you include the TSA combo lock but its not included on the features tab, so what does that tell you about the reliability of your features tab?\\""<br /><br />So I asked for the retail packing slip showing all the things included with the retail Tumi alpha 2 bag.  She said that the features page served that purpose.  Well, we all know about the completeness/reliability of the features tab.  It doesn't supplant the retail packing slip.<br /><br />So here I am, purchased a brand new bag retailing for $600 without a clear answer to whether the hanger which is depicted in the sales webpage is included with the shipment or not..................<br /><br />So an email from Tumi customer service emails me back telling me to ask Amazon about the packing slip.  Well, maybeI can ask them about the hanger.<br /><br />Two possible outcomes.<br /><br />1. If the hanger is included with the shipment, well, I don't have mine and you forgot to put mine in the bag and your employees and features page don't have a clue as to if it should be included or not.<br /><br />2.  If the hanger is NOT included with the shipment, well.........  Its a bait and switch.  Your picture specifically advertises it and there is no disclaimer within the picture to say that it isn't included.  What would make the matter worse is if there is a fine print somewhere that say \\""oh and by the way, hanger sold separately\\"".  Well, then take the picture with the hanger off the webpage or put a asterisk below it as to not mislead your customers.<br /><br />A very messy and a murky marketing situation by a company branding itself as a premium luggage company.",16166.0

I knew that I would be going to Aruba at the end of March. First of all, the wheels are fixed in place and do not maneuver well. I could live with that. I should have researched it better to select the any direction wheels. The extension handle is made of two hollow metal bars about the thickness of a soda can. I had great difficulty getting the handles out and in. With effort I was able to extend the handle to pull the luggage properly. I noticed within the first 5 minutes through the airport that one of the extension rods already had a kink in it. I checked the large bag in and used the smaller one as a carry on. When I boarded the plane, I could not get the extension handles to retract. Finally, after pushing with all my might, the extension rods retracted and I was able to put it in the overhead. Upon landing in Aruba, I had the same problem again, but finally got the handles to extend. They stayed that that way until I reached the rental car. At that point I could not retract the handle once again so I put the bag in the trunk with the handle extended. On the way home I had the same problem over and over. upon arrival, i could not fully extend the handle once again. It only came up half way. I had to hunch over for about 200 yards to retrieve my vehicle. I had nearly 80 pounds of luggage, so I could not carry the luggage by the handles. by the time I reached my car, I noticed that, because the bag was dragging somewhat, it completely ripped the material at the bottom of the bag clear through. I now have a carry on with a 10&#34; tear across the bottom that cannot be repaired and an extension handle that never worked right from the start.

There is a soft bottom and it is not rigid which I didn't like either.  I tried to make it more rigid by cutting a piece of cardboard and fitting it to the bottom of the bag.  The very front section will hold your personal items - keys, phone, pens.  The next zipper will be the dirty section - holds the soap, hand sanitizer.  Overall I hate this bag - after filling it I put it on my shoulder and it was lopsided and looked bulky.  My Hopkins held everything this bag held and didn't look lopsided or bulky. Also, the material is a soft canvas like material - easy to get dirty and very difficult to clean.  The Hopkins bag is nylon-  I can wipe down with alcohol or Lysol wet wipes.  I will be returning this bag and looking at upgrading to another Hopkins instead.",16158.0

The reason for this review is to make clear to other prospective buyers that this bag is very very small and not particularly practical for normal people.  If amazon allows, I will attach photos to illustrate but I'll try to be as descriptive as possible here.<br /><br />There are two main compartments to the bag.  The larger is situated closer to your body when the bag is worn.  This compartment is separated from your back (or front) by a panel of 1/4&#34; thick medium density foam which is completely unnecessary.  The microscopic capacity of the bag dictates that it could never be loaded to the point where such serious padding would be useful.  The equally padded, and non-removable, shoulder strap is also overwrought and ironically makes the bag less comfortable than it might have been with an uncushioned strap.<br /><br />Between the back wall of the pack and the interior of the larger compartment is a paper thin divider that's meant to be a dedicated tablet sleeve.  A full size iPad fits in here vertically, but protrudes horizontally beyond the divider by 1/2&#34;.  A 9.5&#34; x 6.5&#34; x 2&#34; book completely fills the remainder of this compartment with just enough room left over to possibly shoehorn in a small point and shoot camera or sunglass case.<br /><br />If you're very good at Tetris, the smaller compartment can hold 2 pens, an iPod or iPhone sized device and maybe a small bifold wallet.  Sewn to the wall of the smaller compartment is a credit-card-sized pocket which claims to be shielded against radio waves which, according to the manufacturer, makes it harder for unsavory characters to steal information from your credit cards or passport which just barely fits inside.  While tech-savvy thieves with some sort of radio-stealing ray gun might be foiled by this feature - a more traditional bad guy would have less trouble separating you from your credit cards because you've unwisely stored them in the outermost possible location of this backpack.<br /><br />Which brings me to the alleged &#34;slashproof&#34;ness of this bag.  If you feel through the material of the bag, you can definitely make out thin wires sparsely crisscrossing certain sections of the pack.  The strap is also embedded with some sort of wire.  The manufacturer boasts that these wires are stainless steel but makes no mention that they are extremely thin.  As I intend to return this bag for a refund, I won't perform a dissection but I'd be shocked if these wires were any thicker than 18 gauge and so I very much question how effective they'd be against a thief armed with a tiny wirecutter or even a swiss army knife scissor.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you decide if this is the right bag for your purposes.  In my opinion, this bag is so small as to be useless.  It can't hold much more than can my jeans' pockets - which are a much safer place for wallets, phones, credit cards, etc.  The &#34;slashproof&#34;ing wires do not encompass the entire pack and are of such apparent light-duty construction that even in the areas in which they appear, they wouldn't give me one whit of confidence against theft.",16132.0

Because these suitcases have an expandable feature, there is an extra zipper next to the main zipper.  This zipper is opened so the suitcase can &#34;expand&#34;.  This extra zipper expansion feature creates a LOT of give all around the zipper.  So, when you pick up the suitcase by either non-telescoping handle, you find that one side of the zipper seam, is bearing the weight of the entire suitcase PLUS its contents.  This would doubtfully survive handling by baggage carriers without the seam of the zipper tearing.  Then the suitcase would no longer be held shut and at least some your things would fall out.<br /><br />Design flaw #2: When the suitcase is open flat for packing and then closed, the expansion feature gives the suitcase top enough &#34;give&#34; that the top of the suitcase falls into the bottom, making zipping the largest one closed almost a two person job.<br /><br />The dimensions of the suitcases do not include the wheels or casters.  JUST the suitcase body.  So you'd only be able to use the smallest one for carry-on.<br /><br />The telescoping handle felt so flimsy I doubt it would hold up to being used with a loaded suitcase without bending or snapping.<br /><br />When feeling around the inside of the suitcase, I was nearly cut by something sharp.  I unzipped the lining and saw plastic cut jaggedly and at odd angles.  The lining wouldn't have lasted long before the weight of things inside rubbing against the jagged plastic tore it.<br /><br />The ABS has so much give and feels like it has so little tensile strength that any other bag placed on top of it would bend it without it &#34;popping back into shape&#34; without cracking.<br /><br />I returned the next day after receiving and would never trust travelling with these bags.",16116.0

It has a very cheap and flimsy feel to it.  Started off by installing 2 AAA batteries and then setting the time and the date.  So far so good.  But setting the correct date DID NOT result in the correct day of the week.  A problem others reported.  I played with it for about 20-30 minutes and never could get it to display that Jan 29 was a Wed.  It thought it was a Friday and I could not change it's mind.<br /><br />So I thought I would take out the batteries to power it down and start all over.  As I extracted battery number 1, the small spring in the battery compartment came loose from it's base.  That did it for me.  I will be starting the return process tomorrow.<br /><br />One more comment - I was exploring the alarm feature and was cycling through the 8 or 9 available alarm sounds.  None of them were very good.  A second datapoint for the cheap feel to this alarm clock.  As for being too big to be a travel clock - while I definitely would not want it to be any bigger, I personally did not find it too big to be a travel alarm clock - had everything else been in order.<br /><br />Flimsy and cheap feel with features that do not work - do not recommend.",16100.0

I travel extensively and use different bags for different trips. I really did like this bag, however, I have used the bag no more than 10 times, and of course US Air broke one of the wheels during a lost luggage cluster. Anyway, after contacting Travelpro (it took me a few days to get to the correct person - however they did call me back) they explained to me that the wheels are not covered by the warranty.  Really.....the wheels are the bag!  Initially they wanted me to send in and have them look at the bag at my expense to decide if it was covered by the warranty.  Where they would then charge me to repair the wheels or give me the parts to repair myself. After complaining a bit they said that they would send me a shipping label and I could send it in for them to determine the problem.  The problem I told them was that a wheel was broken...lol...my goodness...which they said again was not covered by the warranty. So, why take my time and energy to send in a 70.00 bag for them to charge me Lord knows how much to buy a new wheel and  either have them install or me install at a minimum wait of 3 weeks; I threw it in the garbage....what a  joke....I had a 22&#34; Nautica bag for over 2 years on countless trips that I paid 50.00 for that was twice the bag as this one....and even to the end the wheels worked fine.

When it arrived, it was horribly deformed.  The bottom was curved and would not sit flat.  It just fell over.  The purse was also bent sideways.  Also, it would not stay closed.  There was visible glue in certain spots.  I contacted Cyclus for a refund, they told me they would issue me a credit to 3 of their online stores for the amount.  After spending this amount, I wasn't willing to take a chance.  They refused to refund me.  I contacted Paypal.  They ruled in my favor, but because Cyclus only has a Bogata, Columbia address on file, that is the only place I was to return the purse.  Not the distribution center in California.  Shipping to Columbia was going to cost $700+ and that didn't include the at-the-door sign-for tax.  That if they refuse to pay, I would be out of even more money.  Paypal attempted to contact them.  They didn't respond.  Paypal said they would pay for the shipping and sent me $19.14 and expected a tracking number.  You cant provide a tracking number without sending the package.  And Cyclus refused to give an address within the US.  Paypal informed it that it has been 45 days and they received no tracking number and changed their judgement in favor of Cyclus.  Now, I am out of $237.26 and stuck with the most horrible purse you will ever see.  We bought it because of the cool design.  Cool design + deformity = ... I cant describe it.  I will be willing to send photos to anyone who wants to see.  It you still decide to purchase from Cyclus, be sure to use Amazon.  I think you will be better protected.

I've tried on all surfaces, including the smooth tile in various airports and I still end up pulling it.  Secondly, after my latest trip, one of the four &#34;stops&#34; along the side of the suitcase came off, leaving two sharp screws exposed.

After all the rave reviews, I made it my next carry on bag, and it didn't last no more than 10 minutes before I knew it just wasn't for me.<br /><br />The dimensions are off... not by much, but they are nonetheless. I'll measure the bag again later before returning it. That does mean that some airlines will ask you to gate check it, and what better way than having that question answered on my first flight with it? Flight to Savannah on Delta... my friend and I both had the Avolve 22... I passed to board the plane... they held him back to have it gate checked. He got out of it by removing a light jacket from the bag. I'm not convinced it would always be that easy however. This was during the now infamous polar vortex... amidst flight cancellations and build up at the gates... the overwhelmed crew just let him off the hook.<br /><br />The outer pockets are a huge waste of space! Great idea to have a padded sleeve, but for it to run the length of the luggage with the goal of keeping a laptop inside is overkill. Business travelers don't carry 17\\"" laptops. Wait... who does anymore? So not sure if this will pass the test of time. Laptops are being phased out in favors of tablet, or tablet size laptops. This bag would have been better designed by giving back this extra 2\\"" of outer pocket to the main packing area instead.<br /><br />Another thing that bugs me is that the outer pockets are pretty much rigid... so even on empty, your bag will still appear to be overstuffed. It also makes it a lot easier for it to topple over if it's top heavy.<br /><br />Difficult to wheel on carpeted floors (that means just about everywhere at the airport, and plane)... I can't remember a single time where I made any \\""practical\\"" use of the spinner feature.<br /><br />Another thing that bugged me was when at security screening. The backside of this luggage is all fabric. There are no plastic backings or feet that would help this luggage glide down those tables easily. It was rather impossible to slide it down those tables. You either have to jerk it down them tables or wheel it all the way to the xray scanner's feeder rolls. It's very inconvenient when it is meant to be a multitasking assembly line to make your way to the scanners... sliding your baskets and luggage down that table all the while emptying pockets, removing belt, shoe, etc... With this luggage you pretty much have to stop everyone in their track so that you can do all that, and it is only when you're done that you can start walking to the scanners. One advice... don't look behind you at a frustrated build up of people fuming and struggling to hold back any obscenities for holding them back.<br /><br />The inner hanging sleeve does not run the length of the luggage. Silly, but while I am knocking this luggage, why not add it as another reason for not liking it?<br /><br />Why not mention this as well then? NO SUITERS!<br /><br />Overall, this bag pretty much falls short of any expectations one can possibly have of a carry on luggage... my search continues!",16080.0

Based on the other reviews, I ordered the Bucky Luggage 40 Blinks Ultralight Sleep Mask in brown. While I like the design of this one better, as it fits better over the nose, this is by far the WORST and most DANGEROUS mask I have ever encountered.<br /><br />Problem #1:  When I took it out of the package, it had a very strong chemical smell. So I let it air out for a day and even washed it before wearing, but although the odor had dissipated somewhat, it was still noticeable.<br />Problem #2:  When I finally did wear it to sleep, I woke up with red, itchy, crusty eyes! This has NEVER happened before in all of my years wearing a sleep mask -- I do not have sensitive eyes or eye problems, and the mask was not too tight over my eyes.<br />I slept without the new mask the next night, and my eyes were just fine -- no itchiness or redness. The following night, I wore the mask one more time to sleep, and I woke up with itchy, crusty eyes all over again! I discontinued use of the mask immediately thereafter and returned it.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's specifically the brown one that had these problems while the other colors do not, but I would not recommend this mask at all.

On the upside, the magnets are a pretty cool feature, and they're pretty subdued with no garish branding aside from the magnetic logos.

I buy all my gifts on amazon, and read all reviews to make my decisions.  This is the first thing I have purchased here that has not held up to my standards.  I spent around $150 dollars for this bag, because it had a lot of space, it was very professional looking without appearing \\""dorky\\"" or \\""bulky\\"".  I loved it and was so excited to give it as a gift when I received it because the material was great, it had many different compartments and fit the lap top PERFECTLY.  One of the reasons I chose this particular bag besides it looking sleek and professional while still having the capability of storing many things, was because it appeared it would  withstand heavy use, and carry a lot of different things: computer, papers, files, etc etc.  Well, about a year after I purchased it, the leather completely ripped from the metal hook ring to the actual brief case itself.  There is no way to repair this unless I want to put the hook through the actual material, which defeats the purpose of looking professional.  If I had thought to review this after I bought it and received it, I would have given it 5 stars, I'm glad I waited until now to give my input.  Great for someone who will use less often, do not buy for someone who needs a nice, durable brief case.  I know from experience it is very hard to find that perfect one,  but my advice would be to spend the bucks in a higher end store and examine the hooks and rings that connect before you purchase.  Look at how it is stitched or sewn onto the bag.",16038.0

Tote is fairly light-weight and can be carried comfortably over the shoulder with handle collapsed when empty. In-line skates with harder, thicker plastic bottom and front bump rests is good design as all weight rests on wheels on ground (and not primarily on handle, and thus not on user), weight of contents is properly supported underneath and bag can stand upright when &#34;at rest&#34; with no issues. Handle has two bars, is long enough to be comfortable, has comfortable hand grip and can be collapsed. Tote has zip top and is deeper than it appears in picture.<br /><br />Cons:  Handle does NOT lock open properly so cannot be pushed, only pulled.  Makes it difficult to maneuver into small spaces like elevators or for turns and makes tote too tiring to use for extended periods as you cannot switch off between pulling and pushing.  The interior is completely unfinished and cheap looking - no lining and no pockets. There is one exterior pocket, but it does not seal shut and is very small, flat and tight.  Material of bag is very thin, stiff, cheap plastic canvas substitute - my past experience with this material is that it tends to rip and tear easily and becomes brittle and prone to cracking rapidly, especially in cold weather.  Worst issue is black plastic material of bottom stank when first delivered, and cannot be sold in CA as it is toxic - worst of smell has mostly dissipated, but still stinks and I would not have purchased if I realized how bad it was.  I will say that the other item I purchased recently made of similar black plastic smells even worse than this, but I really, really strongly recommend not buying anything made from this material - I am normally not picky, but there really is something wrong with this stuff.material - I am normally not picky, but there really is something wrong with this stuff.",16033.0

I travel a lot and it seemed like a great buy since it was light, made of polycarbonate and a brand I thought was good and came with a 10 year limited warranty. Within 6 months there was a crack on the right left hand side of the polycarbonate. I thought this would be covered under warranty. Desley refused to replace it stating it was normal wear and tear.  I still kept on using it and now there are other tears in the bag. I've now bought another bag to replace this one. Rest assured it wasn't a Desley.<br /><br />Learnings: Not all polycarbonates are the same. There are higher grades which obviously wasn't the case with this one. Secondly, with full weight, a four dual wheel bag manoeuvres a lot better. So if you're getting a Desley get the next one up.<br /><br />Positives: The combination lock works great.

I was curtly told that is still within their time limit. End of conversation. If you are a traveler, can you really wait 3 to 4 weeks for a repair?<br /><br />When it did finally come back, it was poorly repaired and within a few trips, was worse than ever.

The bag material has held up well as it still looks brand new, however the telescoping handle is not of the same quality. It is made of cheap/thin/flimsy metal and was never really sturdy.

It took Lifeproof 15 months to release these cases after the phone launched and they still got that wrong. At this premium price point there is no excuse for that. It is unrealistic to expect all S3 users to modify every charger we own because of their shabby engineering. And my charger had to have 2.084 mm (measured with a micrometer) trimmed off it to fit correctly. So contrary to what people are saying \\""trim a little off\\"" this is quite a bit to trim off, relatively speaking, and barely leaves a sliver of insulation.<br />And I really shouldn't have to modify something that was an industry standard long before the S3 was released and way before this case hit the market.<br /><br />By contrast, the hole for the headphone jack is plenty big enough to accommodate any headphone plug I own. Which is a good thing because the hole is off center. By a lot.<br />Beats by Dre plug is the largest one (!) tested and it rubs but still fits.<br /><br />Little things like that destroy my confidence in this company's products. And I find it really difficult to believe these flaws passed internal quality control. I bought both this and a Fre at Best Buy (only because I was given a gift card!, I hate that place) so I highly doubt the ones I tried were counterfeit.<br />There is no excuse for something this expensive and released this late after product launch to fit so poorly.<br />They also have a generally cheap feel to the plastic. Definitely not worth the $80+ US. All you are paying for is the name. I am not a fanboy of any other brand, this is the first phone I have owned that I have spent more than $10 for a case. For all my previous phones I have used cheap generic cases bought online and I have never broken a phone yet.<br /><br />I realize I am one of the few people that actually usesmy phone to remotely converse with people, which is the actual definition of a \\""telephone\\"". With this case on, The voice call feature of my premium phone is rendered useless. The only accurate description that fits; it's like listening to someone speaking through a kazoo. The waterproof flaps that cover the mic and (both) speakers rattle.<br /><br />I finally got where I could afford a good phone and I was looking forward to having a Lifeproof brand case on it because I have heard they are the absolute best but I am thoroughly let down by the low quality. The charging door hinge does not feel like it will last a full year of open/close cycles every night.<br />Lifeproof will not be my first choice going forward.<br /><br />-Feels cheap<br />-costs a lot<br />-charger port and headphone jack misaligned<br />-low quality rubber plug for headphone jack<br />-low quality hinge for misaligned charger port flap.<br />-Useless sound quality for voice calls<br /><br />So if your only concern is an expensive waterproof coffin for your S3, this case may be just what you need.

My mistake and one I hoping that you, dear reader, will not make, was in not reading the fine print. In order for my bag to be repaired or replaced, I must send it to them, on my dime, for evaluation along with a $40 dollar &#34;handling&#34; fee!

I can buy a whole new 3 piece set for $125 here on Amazon right now!  Not willing to accept this, I emailed them directly, hoping that I could get them to waive the $40. No such luck.

This left me stuck in NYC without a usable strap. The contents of the bag were:<br /><br />one Lenovo Thinkpad X61s, a subnotebook with weight of around 3.5 lbs.<br />one Sony Xperia Z tablet, weight around 24 ounces.<br />a little battery to charge my phone<br />a little Kodak point-and-shoot camera<br />some extra AA batteries for the above<br />personal items, some chocolate bars<br /><br />The total weight of the load and bag, as measured by a digital shipping scale, was about 13 pounds. The lock hasp broke without warning because it is made of cast aluminum, which does not give warning. Cast aluminum is known to metallurgists to have a fatigue problem. It is a bad choice for a lock hasp. Forged aluminum, or better yet, steel, has far better fatigue strength.<br /><br />If a woven part of the bag were frayed, I would have been smart enough to replace it. But you cannot tell with cast aluminum.<br /><br />Faced with the unpleasant dilemma of a strapless bag in the middle of a trip, I rescued myself with one of the backpack straps stored in one of the zippered compartments of the bag. The strap is only about 12 inches in length, but it was enough to get me back to Penn Station.<br /><br />I emailed the company on 10/21/2013.

It lasted thirty seconds. The first time the handle was extended, it stuck and cannot be collapsed again. Upon closer inspection of the suitcase I noted the following:<br /><br />1. The handle mechanism housing (the tube inside the suitcase) is installed crooked. Not sure if that it why it failed or not, but it probably isn't supposed to be crooked.<br />2. The liner covering the handle mechanism inside the suitcase is sewn in, so you cannot access the handle mechanism.<br />3. The liner is cut too small, meaning the liner does not touch the sides and bottom of the suitcase simultaneously. What this means is you cannot fill the suitcase, it has less available space than it should have. If you fill up the suitcase, the liner is likely to tear at the seams where it is sewn in along the perimeter.<br />4. The zippers do not operate smoothly. They are appropriately sized, but look like cheap pot metal construction/poorly cast rather than quality steel with a finished look.  Zipper manufacturer unknown/generic/no manufacturer markings on them. The zipper has loops for a luggage lock. Overall,  the zippers function but do not inspire confidence that they are built to last.<br />5. Much of the stitching appears inferior where the main zipper is attached to the suitcase perimeter. While the thread itself looks thick enough for the job of holding everything together, the stitch length is varied, and in some places the stitches are nearly half an inch long. This means that the suitcase is held together in places by dozens of stitches, when it probably should be hundreds of stitches.<br />6. The black plastic T-handle is joined to the end of the metal extension tube with a single steel screw. The T-handle has a lot of play in it (wobbles side to side, is loose and moves up and down). It is not solidly attached.<br />7. Cheap wheels and bearings.<br /><br />If this were a $15toy, my expectations would be lower, but at $60 my expectation is that I am getting more of a luggage-type level of construction quality, just in a Hello Kitty shape. This item appears to be built with generic components of questionable quality and mediocre construction. I think this item is significantly overpriced based on as a result. Why is it $60? I guess because people are paying $60. I think a fair price point for this particular item is around $22-23. If it were a normal luggage shape and not a novelty shape like Hello Kitty, I would expect to pay  around $19 or so for a suitcase built like this one is.",16001.0

Plus it still looks like new.  So, I called TravelPro thinking they would stand behind their product and I wouldn't have to go find a new piece of luggage while on my business trip. TravelPro told me to take it to an authorized repair center and that the repair may or may not cost...What?  It's less than a year old!

I used it every day for almost 11 months. It looks great, and I think is really soft. Some reviews have noted that the ends of the straps on the front eventually curl upward, and mine did do this. I didn't really think it was an issue though. Overall my experience was great, except for one huge issue. Periodically (about twice a month) one of the ends of the shoulder strap would magically unclip itself while I was walking. At first I assumed that this was because the clip on the strap was twisted and hooked improperly on the \\""D\\"" loops on the bag itself. So, I was very careful every time I picked up the bag to make sure the clips were properly oriented in the D loops. Nope. Still came unclipped with the same frequency. Why was this such a big deal? Because when the strap lets go, the bag falls to the ground. Mine always has my Macbook Pro in it, so this was an issue. Fortunately, I kept the laptop in a CaseLogic [[ASIN:B004NY9UW8 Case Logic LAPS-113 13.3-Inch Laptop / MacBook Air / MacBook Pro Retina Display Sleeve (Black)]] sleeve. This is an excellent, slim case that protected my laptop from probably 10 drops like this from waist level without so much as a scratch. Eventually, I got so used to this bag releasing that I could reflexively catch the strap as it slid over my shoulder. This would allow me to catch the bag, hanging by one end from the still-attached end of the strap. This is where the final blow came. Last week the bag unclipped in the hallway of my building. I caught the strap, but the bag didn't stop. Instead, the leather loop that ties the metal D loops to the side of the bag ripped out of the leather shell of the bag. This really isn't that surprising if you think about it, as these anchors are meant to handle force from a completely different direction, but what sucks is that the reason it had to handle these weird forces is bad design to begin with. When I buy an $80 bag I expect that it will last more than a year, and that it will not continuously put my $1000 computer through such an ordeal. Consider another product.",15989.0

I contacted Amazon several times as well as on the go luggage. They referred me to Samsonite(Apparently they make Hartmann) I then contacted Samsonite, who i opened a case with and was told someone would get back to me. No one has yet to return my call from Samsonite, nor Has anyone followed up at Amazon or On The Go Luggage. It has been over 2 months now. I have stopped using amazon and will never purchase anything from on the go luggage or Samsonite.

I bought this set because my American Tourister luggage set, which I had owned for 10 years and hundreds of trips, was finally starting to wear out and I thought Samsonite was a name I could trust for another decade of use.<br />Immediately upon receiving this I realized it was very cheaply made.  I know everything is getting cheaper and lower quality these days (and the price for this luggage set was on the low end), but I trusted if it was Samonsite, it would have some minimum quality standards.  Apparently, they've abandoned that policy.<br /><br />First off, the luggage emitted a harsh chemical odor that has only finally dissipated after owning it about 9 months (It was so bad I couldn't have my luggage in the same room or vehicle without getting a headache.)  I've only taken 5 airline trips with this luggage, but every trip something new falls off or breaks on the suitcase.  First it was one of the bottom feet, which made my suitcase wobble when standing upright.  But then the other plastic foot broke off, so now it's more stable.  Then random zippers would fall off (no more using that pocket!)  Then the strap buckle to latch on another piece of luggage broke (guess I'll have to use rope instead).  Then today I arrived at my hotel to find that the main zipper just randomly split open, exposing my clothes to the grime of airport luggage handling operations (I'm just glad stuff didn't fall out).  At this point, I'm worried that it'll catastrophically fail on the trip back home and I'll find a mangled pile of cheap fabric and brittle broken plastic where my stuff used to be.<br /><br />Don't be lured in by the low price! This luggage fails in the most basic tasks - keeping your stuff protected and providing a convenient way to transport it.  I'll never buy a Samsonite product again!",15960.0

I don't have the patience for that so I replaced both factory snaps with solid brass snaps that I purchased online and tossed the original parts in the trash, where they belonged.  Also, the stitching was loose in several places and had to be repaired.  The overall engineering is poor simply because the strap is split at the shoulder pad and it only held in place with a single line of stitching. This created a weak spot that gave way on a long walk through the airport.  It is just a really badly put together item.  The bag that I bought it for is built much better.<br /><br />I ended up doing all the repairs myself because I simply enjoy doing that type of thing and I have the tools to fix it with, and it ended up being a good dependable strap.

With stuff inside, the sides round out and the ends of the inflexible sign stick out and catch on things. - The last straw: one end of the handle strap came off. Now a good quality case often has handle straps that go all the way around underneath, securely supporting the weight of the case. Does this one? Not quite. I found that they made this strap as short as possible, sewing the end into a seam near the top. The load from the handle actually bears on a strip of very thin lining material inside. UNBELIEVABLE. It was designed to fail.  I've had it about a year. The last bag I had cost a third of this one and lasted ten times longer. I'm actually going to cut the handle straps from that bag (they do go all the way to the bottom) and try to rig them up to this one.  I guess I thought paying a little extra and getting a brand name would guarantee a quality item.  My final rating = 1 due to failure that rendered it unusable caused by careless design.  UPDATE - I did pop rivet on the handle from an old bag and used it for two and one half more years. Now, one of the zippers has failed; the fabric gave way that held the zipper coil in alignment and it is utterly useless (and beyond repair). I've just carried ordinary sorts of stuff in the thing: small laptop, notebook, some pads of paper, etc. It's hard to imagine all of the top ratings it has.

The bag in the photos has to be stuffed with paper. This bag has no structure, it's just seamed fabric. Filled with the contents of my Dooney and Bourke tote, the Tumi droops and looks very sloppy - one source of the problem is way the handles are sewn in relation to the top piece (where zipper is). Had the handles been sewn up to the top seam, it would look much better. I also foresee the strap seams ripping if this bag is used to carry the volume of contents that its size would suggest.<br /><br />Carrying the bag is not comfortable or secure. The straps are just short enough that I can't carry it across my body when I would like to be more in control. And because of their thin width, the straps constantly slide down my shoulders, even over non-slippery clothing. The result is a bag that wants to slip slide away, making me look like a pickpocket's dream when I'm trying to get things in and out of it.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, the inside pockets are shallow and nothing stays put for long, not even my iPhone 5.<br /><br />This is a very expensive tote carrying a prestigious label. But in normal use, it just looks like a sloppy nylon bag. Even worse, it doesn't perform like it should for $225.",15920.0

I'm looking at the bag now after six months and about the eighth or ninth go-around, and one of the corners is completely indented.

After using it 4 times, one of the rear wheels malfunctioned, making it useless.  My daughter had to drag it to get it home.  It supposedly has a 10 year warranty.  I contacted customer service and they said that since there are no repair centers in my area, I would have to send the suitcase to them, at my expense, and IF they determined that there was a manufacturer defect, they would repair and return it to me.  Otherwise, I would be responsible for the cost of repair and return postage.  How could this possibly NOT be a defect?  I asked if they could just send me the wheel assembly replacement part, and they said no because they had none in stock (I wonder how THEY were going to fix it without the part?).  I emailed customer service and told them this was not acceptable - I would not pay to have a defective item repaired, and I again requested that they send me the part so I could repair it myself.

After using it 4 times, one of the rear wheels malfunctioned, making it useless.  My daughter had to drag it to get it home.  It supposedly has a 10 year warranty.

Otherwise, I would be responsible for the cost of repair and return postage.  How could this possibly NOT be a defect?  I asked if they could just send me the wheel assembly replacement part, and they said no because they had none in stock (I wonder how THEY were going to fix it without the part?).

This is my final review - promise.<br /><br />When I first purchased 2 of these briefcases, it was clear that the Achilles heel was the locking mechanism. The tumblers did not turn easily. As time went by, I noticed that the hinges were very cheaply made and started to bend at their contact point with the case. But still the case seemed ok for the $49 I paid for each. Finally, just outside of 6 months, the locks on one case failed. I contacted Amazon and Alpine Swiss. Amazon asked if I'd like a refund or replacement. I took a replacement because so many reviews here were so very complimentary. I thought maybe I had received a lemon. The replacement arrived today. The locks failed right out of the box. The tumblers would not move(and I do know how to set these locks). I have arranged an immediate return.<br /><br />Kudos to Amazon who fulfilled this order both times. They always stand behind their items. As for Alpine Swiss, someone wrote me and suggested in a rather cryptic manner that I did not know how to work the locks or that I had failed to recall the combination. I guess the best defense is a good offense. Had I received that email before taking a replacement, I would have simply taken a refund.<br /><br />I'll add a final note that I suspect all the locking mechanisms on these briefcase that are made of the sort of aged brass material are garbage and probably manufactured by the same company overseas.

Pockets are convenient and holds everything of mine well. About 6 months into using it it started to fall apart. The canvas is separating from the hems near the top handle and the side bottle carrier. Threads are sticking out everywhere and get caught up in the zippers often. I've treated it well and have not abused these areas. I think wehn I've had to run through rain or to catch a train the motion and weight of  the contents is too muchfor the construction. I've also had issues with the zippers separating on theri own as it moves on my back. If the zippers are moved together at the top of the bag the walking motion makes it separate and eventually open while on my back exposing my laptop and any contents in that section. I'm very disappointed  with this bag and didnt think that paying $80+ would provide such a short lived life. Samsonite doesn't seem to have an easy way of getting it replaced on warranty. The closest service center is 5 hours away and I live in the DC metro area. This backpack didnt even last a year. Fail.,15898.0

Actually, I've been very disappointed by this bag twice. I bought it as a carry on for a trip out of the country and stored some clothes in it.<br /><br />[Bag 1] When I began packing with my first bag, I noticed that most of the rings were starting to break off of the fabric (if you look at the 6th picture, I'm talking about those rings). But I decided to give it another chance because the reviews were mostly positive and mentioned its durability. So I returned that bag and ordered a new one.<br /><br />[Bag 2] This bag survived the packing process! However, it did not make it through my international flight. This time the ring that held the clip in broke off (again see the 6th picture - I am referring to central clip that goes through all of the other rings). In addition to this, the buckles attached to the side pockets both fell off.<br /><br />So here are my Pros/Cons<br /><br />[PRO] The bag does look nice & durable. If you want to look adventurous, its great for that.<br /><br />[CON] The bag doesn't stay together. If you want to be adventurous (like fly 14hrs - crazy I know), it is a terrible bag for that.<br />[CON] The bag's straps are very uncomfortable if you are carrying a little weight.<br />[CON] The leather straps are so thin and stretch out very easily.<br /><br />Altogether - not $50 quality, possibly $15 quality.

First of all, this suitcase is way too BIG. I purchased this size bag so that I would have room for all the stuff that I was going to buy on my trip. I had a lot to learn... Even without filling the suitcase (primarily with clothing items), I was over the 50 lb. weight limit. The bag is soft sided on the sides (i.e. no support) so the combination of the size and soft sides make this bag difficult to maneuver. When I picked up my bag in the Hawaii airport, it was filthy so I have learned that purple is not a good color for a suitcase. In addition, the edges of the suitcase were already showing wear and one of the zipper pulls came off. Keep in mind, this is the FIRST time that I have used this suitcase! A few of the people who handled my luggage made negative comments about it.  Upon arriving home, when I picked up my bag, I noticed how much filthier it was, and I noticed that the edges of the suitcase were tattered and in some spots torn. I am ready to trash this bag.

Currently, Tumi seems to be looking for brand conscious customers who don't care about price and don't understand what -- beyond branding -- makes one piece of luggage better than another.  Tumi should remember that the reason they got to be famous was because they were better than the alternatives.  Tumi products were more durable AND more convenient than their competitors.

The item arrived on time, but the quality is really lacking in the faux suede, one look and its obvious that this will not wear well, also it your looking for a piece that will handle a few pair of shoes and a 3-5 day stay, this isn't it. The leather was of good quality. The most damaging part of this was when I requested to retuurn the item the seller responded with questions, instead of a return authorization. When I reinterated the bag was too small, I was insulted and called rude, and refused a return auth even though I only had the bag one day. I advise all Amazon customers to stay away from this vendor. I immediately contacted Amazon, they reviewed the E-mail responses sent to me and took over, readily agreeing that not only was the return warranted under policy, but the severity of the treatment was uncalled for. I shop with Amazon every month and love this company.. I feel I must warn any customers who may chose an item from this St Beach Company to Stay Away.",15884.0

However, after about 5 uses the trigger lock stopped popping up on its own.  In other words, I could not close the umbrella with one hand.  I had to pull the umbrella closed and pull up the lock with my other hand.  Clearly the internal spring is broken.<br /><br />By the time the umbrella started acting up I was past Amazon's return period.  Even though I had only used the umbrella a handful of times, I was over 30 days.  I contacted the seller e-bags and was told I was past their return date also.  Again, to be clear, it rarely rains where I live, so, although the umbrella was over 30 days old it was barely used and practically brand new.  E-bags told me to contact the manufacturer and gave me London Fog's contact info.<br /><br />Well, it turns out that even though this is marketed as a &#34;London Fog&#34; umbrella, and that &#34;London Fog&#34; is stamped on the handle, it is actually made by another company.  I was told to contact the actual manufacturer.  After waiting a week for an email response (because of course they don't answer the phone), I was told to box the umbrella up, ship it to them, and include $6 for return postage for a new or fixed umbrella.  Oh, and that it would take 6 weeks to get my umbrella back.<br /><br />So, to get a replacement for this $28 umbrella I had to pay for a box, pay for shipping 2 ways, and wait 6 weeks.  I threw it out.  What a joke.  Buy at your own risk.",15882.0

The leather - especially the all important bottom area under the bag, is very thin.  I am not saying this is a bad bag, as most bags go.  But most leather briefcases are really flimsy and fall apart pretty quickly, so that is not saying much.  At $398, I expected much more. Live and learn.  Really sad, as I was sure this was the one.

The problem with bag is not how it was designed, but instead how the design was implemented. As with any bag, the area under the most stress is the handles, because the handles carry all of the weight. Within a period of less than six months, the inside corners of the handle began to rip apart. Now, I see how the handle is made. Effectively it is cardboard, wrapped with a thin veneer of black leather. The only way to do this correctly would have been to use a much stronger type of material on the inside of the handles, again wrapped with their light leather material. So, now I'm left with a briefcase that works great when it is sitting down, but is in danger of falling out of my hands when I carry it. I have had to resort to Duck Tape covered with an overwrap of black electrical tape to secure the handles. If only they had spent a few more cents to create a decent handle in the first place, this would have all been solved. I wrote to the manufacturer about this and they did not respond. Consequently, I'm sharing my experience with the bag with everyone. When looking at a bag, the first place to look for quality is in the handles. They will be the first point of failure.",15877.0

The purchase through Amazon was fine.  The luggage is nice looking and easy to spot in baggage claim.  They're also roomy inside and surprising light (not the lightest, but much lighter than our previous set).<br /><br />Unfortunately the durability on this luggage is terrible.  We've had 3 handles rip from their rivets in the last 6 months.  We're not overloading them, in most cases we don't exceed 40 lbs and since you can't check baggage at over 50 lbs without a surcharge we've never been over that limit.  We're also not extensive travelers.  None of the pieces have been used more than 3 times at this point.<br /><br />The fun begins when you try to make a warranty claim.  Nautica warranties are handled by Randa Luggage.  They only have e-mail correspondence and there are no service centers - they require you to send in photos of the damage upon which they will either mail you parts to fix it yourself or (if they deem non-fixable) replace the luggage.  All of this takes 5 weeks minimum (they claim 3-5, but that hasn't been my experience).  Not only is this a hassle I'm concerned the handles will continue to break and I've wasted a fairly good chunk of money on items which I'll be lucky to get just 2-3 years out of.<br /><br />My recommendation would be stay away from Nautica and go with a company that has authorized service centers and a real warranty.  Good luck.",15872.0

The arms barely fit around my niece's neck, and she isn't a large girl!  Actually, they are both somewhat small for their ages.  And the blankets barely hit the knees.<br /><br />We were quite sad.  We ended up rolling up their favorite throws inside of the monkey (him) and ladybug (her).

Ordered the &#34;aqua blue&#34;.  Very pretty in the picture here on Amazon.  Actual luggage is not aqua blue at all.  It is a very DARK almost greenish color.  Not light, and not blue, and not aqua.  Very dark, flat, bland, ugly.  Yuk.  I'm very disappointed, and so is my daughter.  Okay, the color aside, this luggage is extremely poor quality.  There is no structure to it at all - and yet it's heavier than I would think which seems odd to me.  The best I can describe it, would be some really hard cardboard covered with a thin, cheap cloth.  If it were laying down flat (packed), and you were to stack the smaller packed piece on top of it, there's no way it would hold up.  It would have to permanently disfigure the case (like stepping on a shoe box or something similar).  The zipper and zipper pulls don't seem substantial at all, and caught a few times when trying to open and close it.  The inside material looks cheap.  There is one mesh zippered pocket on the lid, and that's it.  There are no other pouches or compartments...just one big empty cardboard box.  The &#34;reinforcements&#34; around the corners are useless.  The bottom of both larger pieces was sagging between the wheels from where they had been nestled.  Handles do not seem durable at all.  I can see where others said they pulled off.  Seriously doubt that they could withstand lifting packed luggage by them.  These should not be considered as &#34;expandable&#34;.  This was the oddest thing I've ever seen in the way of expandable luggage.  Of the four sides, the zipper starts at the bottom left, goes up and around the top, and ends at the bottom right in a U-shaped wedge sort of.  So you get about an inch of expansion near the top of the case only.  Very odd, and totally useless.  I knew I wasn't going to get top quality for the price, but definitely expected better.  These were returned the same day.",15860.0

I do a lot of traveling and have been using the bag for about 6 months.  I will admit that I do tend to over-pack, but the bag did not hold up to my constant traveling.  The first thing that started to go were the seams around the zippers.  Over time they started to stretch out.  If the bag had made it a little bit longer, those probably would have ripped at some point.  What eventually killed the bag was the seem where the shoulder strip connects just tore.

The wheels are not large enough for the case, so when you are pulling it along using the pull out handle - the case is at an angle, the bottom edge drags on the ground.  Hence the plastic just wore away due to abrasion and left a big hole.

(And no, Chicago is not nicknamed the &#34;Windy City&#34; for that reason.)  My review below is based upon light winds of 5-10 mph.  I won't even use this umbrella for windier rainy days.  There are several reasons why I don't like this umbrella:<br /><br />1.  The circumference is too small.  It barely covers me and my purse.  If I am carrying my laptop bag to work it gets soaked.  I wouldn't dream of using this umbrella while out shopping carrying several bags.  This size is more appropriate for a child.  Note:  I am not one of those people who uses a golf umbrella and gobbles up the entire sidewalk.<br /><br />2.  The fiberglass arms are VERY flimsy.  When I was walking against a light wind (5 mph) the arms were bending over and pushing the canopy into my face.  When this happened my view became obstructed.  When I raised the umbrella, the wind caught it just so that the umbrella inverted and I got wet.<br /><br />3.  The wind tunnel top part is too short.  Because of this, when the wind direction suddenly changes, such as when one is rounding the corner of a building, the umbrella inverts leaving the person exposed to the rain.  This happened to me on several occasions, even in light winds.<br /><br />4.  The auto open/close feature is flawed.  After pressing the auto close button and you want to open the umbrella again, you have to MANUALLY open it up first to engage the strings that are connected to the fiberglass arms to reset the button.  This happens to me when I stop for my morning coffee before heading to the office.  I use the auto close feature to close the umbrella when I enter the coffee shop.  When I exit the coffee shop I have to manually open the umbrella (while trying to hold on to a hot cup of coffee).",15831.0

I bought this product because of the various very positive reviews. However, I have severe doubts, the Delsey Helium Aero would survive a single, let alone transatlantic, flight: The outside is so thin that I - a petite woman - can bend it with my bare hands (!!!). While being stretchy prevents the suitcase from breaking due to hard impacts, I am afraid it's too bendable to prevent its contents from breaking.<br />Another not-so-nice feature is, that there even were a few scratches and marks on the suitcase already, even though it has been wrapped up in plastic and not been used for travelling. Thus, I don't even want to imagine what it would look like being handled by an airline?!<br />Another reason why I disliked this suitcase was that it didn't run smoothly on carpet. But that would be nice to handle it in like hotels.<br />The inside cushion did not meet my expectations either: it's made out of cheap, thin plastic, and even my 30$ no-name suitcase has a better fitting. All I can say is: I returned this to Amazon in an instance.<br /><br />edit:<br />In case that should be of any interest to someone,I decided to buy this [[ASIN:B00729P4GW Johnston & Murphy 28' Multiwheel Road Agent]]. It's like 130$ more, but appears to be totally worth the money. The inside is extremely high-quality. I bought it in town, and the lady at the store said she NEVER had this type of suitcase returned.

When it broke, I noticed that the support on the neighboring piece was already bending in a way that indicated it would break soon enough. When it did, I shelved it for a few weeks, utterly disgusted. Then upon bringing it out again, another piece snapped. It is now unusable. I hate this umbrella, it frustrates and disappoints me in the worst way. There is no doubt, I will never be buying Senz again.

When we got home, we found that a seam, right next to the zipper had split open, and you could stick your hand into the suitcase without opening it.  On close inspection, I realized the problem.  The seam stitching was terribly erratic.  At some points along the zipper, there was a nice 1/4 in hem.  In other places, like where it ripped out, there was less than an 1/8 inch hem.  The hem was so uneven, it looked like the person running the sewing machine was drunk :-)  The other suitcase is just as bad.  We are just lucky that one did not rip out too.

It was a great bag until the nylon fabric ripped at a seam during a recent vacation, making bag unusable.  We sent it into the factory as warranty repair ($30 freight).  They returned it as un-repairable, with note stating it was not warranty issue, but rather a normal wear and tear condition not covered by their \\""lifetime\\"" warranty.  (posted photo of fabric tear on Victorinox Facebook pages).<br /><br />I called customer service, talked with customer service manager.  She tells me that I should be satisfied with the 10 years' service we received from the item, and that all things wear out over time!  So I guess the high quality nylon fabric will wear down and tear over time, and that does not count as a material or manufacturing defect?<br /><br />Bottom line, I do NOT recommend paying top dollar for any luggage with a lifetime warranty, unless you can be sure the company will honor that warranty for as long as you own the luggage.

I LOVE the side sling bags! (I have 2 for each stroller.) I have the parent's console tray and the tray that attaches to my child's belly bar, as well as the soft belly bar with cup holders for one of my strollers. All of these are fantastic products!<br /><br />I have recently purchased your Cool 'N Cargo Stroller Cooler from Amazon.com and I was excited for it to arrive. Unfortunately, this particular item has not met my expectations, nor do I think it lives up to your company's products. Right out of the box, it's extremely soft. I added water bottles and it doesn't hold it shape very well and is saggy on my stroller. Please make it more rigid. Secondly, the interior feels very inferior. There is no shape to it. I understand the one piece design of it to wipe it out easily, but it's very cheap looking. Finally, it's barely insulated. That's the reason  I bought the \\""cooler\\"" to begin with! There is no way this cooler is going to keep my youngest child's sippy cups cold during one of my older son's baseball games. Basically, I feel like I overpaid for a cheap \\""store brand\\"" diaper bag that happens to clip to my stroller.<br /><br />One more issue...the center Velcro is a great idea to keep the bag from sagging, but most umbrella style strollers have a pull system to collapse the bag in the middle as well. Perhaps you would think about moving the one center piece of Velcro to two pieces a little of center on each side. Just a thought.<br /><br />If you would revamp this cooler, I would happily repurchase, even at a higher price tag because the concept is great. The current product is lacking and cheap. Mine, that I received today, is going in our family's Goodwill pile.<br /><br />Thank you for listening to my concerns.",15808.0

The bag that I received is NOT expandable.  The description states &#34; World’s first EXPANDABLE two-compartment hybrid hard shell luggage • New expansion feature gives you the option to pack more (when fully expanded, it becomes a checked baggage) &#34;  However, the bag that I received lacks the additional zipper (shown in the product photos on Amazon) that allow you to expand the bag.<br /><br />I purchased a Travelers Choice Sienna Hybrid Hard-Shell Rolling Garment Bag about a year ago.  I'm a weekly business traveler and have used the bag for virtually all of my trips.  I do not like checking my bags and this bag fits in MOST overhead bins wheels out, but not all.  There are some 737's with bins that lack the depth to slide it in wheels out, so it must be turned sideways.  Not a huge issue unless you are in Boarding Zone 4 of a crowded flight.  The upper and lower compartment design is an excellent feature.  I like the fact that my shirts and dress pants can go right from the closet into the upper garment bag section on the hanger.  Lower compartment has plenty of room for and extra pair of shoes and all of your other gear.  Those are all of the positive aspects of this bag.  However, after a year of use there are some downsides as well.  Cheap construction is the biggest downside.  The zippers and other hardware are poor quality and the interior lining has ripped due to the constant use.  I would caution anyone thinking about checking this bag, because I'm doubtful it would hold up.  At $59.00 this is a good bag that has some nice features, but realize that if you are a business traveler like me it will only last a year or two.  I went to buy a replacement and the same bag in Black has now gone up to $101.00.  Definitely not worth that price.",15801.0

It was attached by a single small Philips screw, and with the hand piece out of place, the steel rod that makes the retractable handle work apparently fell out of the shaft on the flight.  We had to take the handle mechanism completely apart to figure this out.<br /> Given how little the bag's been used, this is obviously an inadequate way to attach the handle.  I've emailed Sampsonite to see if I can get the replacement parts.  Be advised that the warranty requires you to take the bag, or ship it, to a service center, where they'll charge you $10 - $26 for deciding whether or not to honor the warrantee - a typically useless arrangement, unfortunately.  Before the handle broke, the bag worked very well - having 4 wheels on the bottom is a nice feature, but keep a close eye on the screws if you decide to buy this bag!  They render the whole handle mechanism pretty fragile.<br /><br />Update: In response to my email request for parts to fix this ourselves, we were told that we would hear from someone within seven days (we never did); then, in response to my repeated calls, that we could mail the entire suitcase Massachusetts, at our expense; that replacement parts could be sent; and finally, that no replacement parts are made for this bag.

This bag is soft to the touch, durable, easy on the eyes, and sophisticated- as another reviewer pointed out. I commute and take my bike to work, and this bag has been a fine companion on my journeys. I needed something to carry small books, glasses, cellphone, iPod, water bottle, gloves, and other small items. Inside you'll find two small compartments within which you can setup your phone and other accessories. You'll also find a compartment which you can use to stow a small book or tablet, and right over that, you'll find a small zippered pocket which comes in handy for items needing easy access. In addition to this small zipper, you'll find zippers on the outer part of the bag; both under the flap and the posterior part of the bag(closest to your body). The quality is excellent. One fantastic quality is the fact that the more you use it, the better it looks. This is thanks to it's distressed construction. I've really grown to love this bag and I would happily recommend it to anyone who's contemplating buying it.<br /><br />Edit: After using it for almost a year, this bag's durability has disappointed me. One qualm was the stitching between the two inner pockets began to come apart. That wasn't a big deal, considering my sister is great at sewing. What was a big deal, however, was the fact that the strap slowly but surely fell apart; this was due to, in my belief, the design of the rings that attach the straps to the bag. They have a square design and this cuts into the straps. The 'Visconti' metal plate that sits in the back of the bag also fell off, since it's only glued on apparently, but this wasn't a gripe since I don't care about the brand's display.<br /><br />After contacting the seller through Amazon, they were nice enough to send me another bag, free of charge! This I appreciated, since I settled into thinking my original purchase was probably a defective item. Alas, I was mistaken! After no more than 5 uses, the strap completely fell off.  You'll notice in the last picture that the leather is only glued on and not sewn where the strap connects. I'll attach pictures to illustrate my points.

I read the negative reviews, but thought that surely there must be some way for these pillows to work well.

Somehow, the height and angle were just all wrong - I'm about 5'1\\"" and my husband is 5'11\\"" and we both tried both of the pillows on our laps, on the tray tables, on the armrests, with/without blankets, sweatshirts, etc. - we couldn't get comfortable.

Its a health risk!<br />If someone's worried about being overweight you are looking at heavy bags of around 40 pounds. How on earth are you meant to lift that weight off the ground keeping the scale horizontal. And that to for a few seconds. I feel my back is going to break. Because the strap is so flimsy and slim, it offers no support so here you are lifting a 40 lbs suitcase (not a duffel bag) which is swaying as it is being held up by one tiny strap so all the weight falls on one point. Unless the swinging stops, the machine cannot take a reading.<br /> Its like no thought was put into its design and the laws of physics are being challenged here.<br /><br />Edit: I am returning this to amazon but if I wasn't I would smash it violently, as it is so awful and now my lower back hurts.  its just not worth damaging your back. if you have to use a bathroom scale, then do that.<br />Please note that most of the positive reviews come from those who were sent this product to review. Friends of the owner? And some from people who haven't even tried it! So read the reviews carefully, with a pinch of salt and don't go by the rating. I did and it was a mistake. I should have tried one of the others available. Now its too late as i am travelling today. Yes, I am using the bathroom scale which is not bad and gives a consistent reading each time. Just make sure your's is accurate.<br /><br />Also if you go on youtube and see the official video, you will notice that a duffle bag is being used in the demo. And that too by a tall, built guy. The owner of the company.<br />To understand the ridiculousness of the design, before buying this, take a doubled up piece of thread and hang a tote or bag full of groceries on it. Consider two things: 1) does the bag EVER stop swinging? 2) how hard is it to hold  the bag up by such a thin support ? 3) does the amount of pressure on the thread ( and weight on your hand) vary depending on which part of the strap the thread rests upon?<br />I think this will give you an idea of how bad the design is and the issues you will face with this gadget.<br />At best you can use this to weigh your evening bag.<br /><br />It makes me really angry that such a daft device is being promoted in ways I don't think are 100% genuine. Sorry to say.",15789.0
3225,US,49498420,R3D82S0Z4NO8AU,B0055CHIJ4,474261313,Travelpro Luggage Platinum Deluxe Rolling Tote with Computer Sleeve,Luggage,1,8,9,N,Y,Wanted to love it and the company but can't,"Let me start by saying I've gone through two bags and will be getting my third soon.<br /><br />I'm a first time TravelPro customer and based on all the reviews I read on Amazon and elsewhere on the web along with the comments from TravelPro I expected a rock solid bag and excellent customer service.<br /><br />The first bag I got from Amazon came double boxed with extra padding with no damage to either box whatsoever. Out of the box the bag looked great. However the handle would not go up all the way. The larger articulating arm of the handle on one side was stuck inside the hard plastic hole where it recesses into the case. There was no way of freeing it, even via the access panel from inside. There also seemed (to me) to be quite a bit of handle wiggle. I called TravelPro customer service to see if there was something I was missing or if it was a defective bag. They promptly stated they had never heard such a thing, especially on their most expensive top of the line series. I explained I was a first time customer and this was my first bag from them. They said just return it to Amazon and get another one. OK....<br /><br />Second bag arrived today. I could get the handle all the way up this time but it would get stuck along the way each time, and often not in the same place. You would think you would push and hold the handle and lift up. No I would have to release the button and push down slightly and then press the button slightly and then continue up. It would have similar problems going down, expect I would have to exert some force. In this case it appears the articulating handle arms AS WELL AS the locking pins were getting caught / stuck on the hole in the case again, as well as on other parts on the articulating arm. Again the handle seems to wiggle too much. Likewise again I called TravelPro customer service and again they were prompt to say say we've never heard of such a thing. That's odd since I called last week on the same issue and people on Amazon arereporting the same problem but ok. Again I was told to return AGAIN to Amazon for a third bag.They didn't offer to send me one from their warehouse (perhaps a different batch), they didn't want this one back so they could see what's causing the problems.<br /><br />As a first time customer I think most people would have cut and run at the first or second bag. I'm willing to give them a third try but the quality thus far has been sub-par and while the TravelPro customer service has been prompt to answer the phone and pleasant in tone they haven't gone out of their way to resolve the problem, nor been too concerned about a design flaw, bad batch, improper shipping, etc, nor even really apologetic.<br /><br />03/02/2013<br />Update. Got my THIRD bag today. This time it wasn't even double boxed. The first two were, so this was a bit of (bad) surprise. In either case after taking it out the handle was sticking like the second one, but not frozen like the first one. I was really disappointed to get THREE problem bags in a row. I decided to avoid call TravelPro customer service since all they seem to have to say is we've never heard of such a thing, especially on our high end basg (contradiction there somewhere); send it back (and get another, if you like); or take it in for warranty. Any how I also decided to give it a fair shake like the others. It started to loosen up some. It still catches on the rigid plastic when pushing the handle fully into the case, and likewise when it comes out. Also also still gets stuck when extending to complete and when putting back in. The locking pins seem to get stuck, usually on one side.<br /><br />My older and much less expensive non-TravelPro bags I've had for a decade don't seem to have these problems and I thought I was really stepping up here. It doesn't feel like it. I know things have gotten tougher over the years and companies have raised prices and lowered quality in the same breath so perhaps this is the best one can expect these days.<br /><br />In either case I'm going to keep for a while and put through it's passes before the Amazon return policy expires.<br /><br />The only saving grace is that TravelPro is supposed to stand behind these Platinum bags like nobody's business.<br /><br />Couple of other thoughts:<br />Between the two TravelPro CSR's I wanted to confirm there was no issues with Amazon being an official dealer and that TravelPro would stand behind warranty when purchased from Amazon as TravelPro put's nothing about authorized dealers on their website.<br />1st CSR was of course, like we love Amazon, no issues there.<br />2nd CSR was kind of snooty I thought after being told I bought their \\""high-end\\"" bag from Amazon.<br /><br />Also on bag design the second middle area isn't a pocket / compartment like on some of their lower / other bags. It's actually just a flap that allows access to the back / large area of the case. This area has it's own pock where you can put a laptop. So the \\""flap\\"" allows you to access the main area without opening the whole bag. This \\""seems\\"" like a good idea except the flat faces the front instead of being on top of the pocket inside so you have to kind of bend your hand to get it in. The flap is also smaller than the pocket. This all leads to if you have a wider and or thicker laptop you won't be able to get it in and out.",15789.0

It was comfortable and the valve is superb for quick filling and almost instantaneous deflation. The problem is that the valve has a small black cap that is defective.

Back then I had acquired their Duffle Bag, Messenger Bag, and Travel Case all in Tobacco Brown.  I was targeting their Classic Backpack next but since they didn't return my call :(, I aborted mission and moved on to something else.<br /><br />Then recently I came across this new Saddleback Front Pocket Backpack on Amazon and I fell in love with Saddleback Leather all over again.  I forgave SL for neglecting me in the past and bought the FP Backpack in DK Coffee Brown here on Amazon.  It is absolutely gorgeous!  I love it so much that I decided to buy another one at full price in Tobacco directly at Saddleback Website to match my other SL Tobacco bags.  Being a shopaholic, I ended up spending around $2000 on SL products in the last two months bringing my total investment to around $3000 for a total of 17 SL products.  Yes, 17!  Why?  Being torn between DK Coffee Brown & Tobacco, I decided to get basically two of everything-- DK Coffee for work & Tobacco for travel.<br /><br />Being so in love with SL.  I gladly accepted whatever they sent me.  Some items I purchased through SL Dave's Deals were \\""imperfect\\"" with blemishes, scars, etc.  But I didn't mind since I myself put inevitable marks on them through daily usage.  Then came the Cable Bag... The bag that broke my heart.  I had already acquired the Cable Bag in Tobacco and I was so looking forward to the DK Coffee Brown Cable Bag with Tobacco tie wrap, visualizing how awesome my white Nikon 1 J1 camera would look in it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my DK Coffee Cable Bag did NOT come with the Tobacco tie wrap as depicted in the photo on their website.  Instead it came with matching DK Coffee Brown tie wrap.  It didn't look bad but it didn't look cool... So I emailed SL customer support requesting if they would kindly throw in a Tobacco tie wrap along with the Bible Cover that I had ordered that morning.  I didn't want to go through the trouble of shipping the bagback just because of the color of the wrap.  I really thought it was a simple request, no big deal.  I didn't care if they wanted to charge me for it.<br /><br />Guess what?  The guy responded that I could ship the item back free of shipping charge and reorder the same item,  It'd be \\""a roll of the dice\\"" and HOPEFULLY I'll get the color scheme that I want.  Say what?  Give you more of my hard-earned money & HOPEFULLY I'll get the color I desire?  REALLY?  It's like ordering a dog with blond hair & end up getting a brunette.  But don't worry, keep on ordering until the blond shows up.  REALLY?  It's shocking that they can't control what goes out to their customers.  I understand Dave's Deals have imperfections.  But there's a big difference between \\""IMPERFECTIONS\\"" VS \\""MISREPRESENTATION\\"".  Every photo everywhere shows the DK Coffee Brown Cable Bag comes with a free Tobacco tie wrap.  He said they don't have extra wraps.  He can't guarantee I'll get one with Tobacco wrap.  He can't take a Tobacco wrap from another bag... Blah Blah Blah...REALLY?<br /><br />If they can't simple send me a tie wrap cable, it makes you wonder what's the value of their 100-year warranty?  They are so PETTY, INFLEXIBLE, & STINGY.  They're not willing and/or able to switch out a tie wrap that's advertised as \\""FREE\\"" for a valued customer, then how can you trust them to possibly honor their 100-year warranty on any of their products for anybody???<br /><br />The whole \\""Cable Bag\\"" incident is absurd & ridiculous beyond comprehension.  I don't think I was asking too much from them.

I liked the look of this bag, it was just the right size. Despite the fact that the color wasn't what I'm used to,  I ordered it anyway. When it arrived the smell was extremely overpowering, I'm not exaggerating when I say, it almost took my breath away.

It was obvious it had been stuffed into a box that was too small.<br /><br />After I sent the seller an email with a picture of the bag and the broken pieces, I heard back the same day. The person was helpful, I was told I would get a refund, and that they expected a good review with 5 stars when Amazon asked me to rate the sellers performance. I gave the sellers 5 stars for the sale, because they promised a refund, I and was happy because I didn't have to send the bag back. It's been a few months now, I never got a refund.

If you do buy it, don't give the sellers 5 stars (if you're not happy) until the money is back in your bank account.<br /><br />I paid $29.99 with free shipping.

Considering the December is a short month for school, the bag is hardly used for 2 months. In early February 2013 after about a month and half use of the bag, most of the zippers (including two big zipers for main openings) of the bags are broken making it equivalent to an open trolley to roll stuff in it. I wish there was warranty of even for 6 months would make this bag worth its price, but given the short meaningful life of the zipper, I would give it only one star.<br /><br />If they had made with more durable zipper, i'd give it 4 star - but we are not buying wheels for a bag, and working zipper it just isn't anything.",15770.0

This  bag appears to open up to a nice outer panel where you can store pens and cards, in addition to the inner bag.  This is not true!

It looks cute and shipped QUICK. But as soon as I opened the box, it smelled SO BAD, I nearly gagged. I don't really know how to describe it.

So I hand washed it with regular laundry detergent and rinsed it out very well but it still smelled. I finally gave up trying to wash the smell and now it's hanging outside in the wintry cold air, which will hopefully take the smell away. I'm going to hang out outside for a couple of days and update this review if I ever get the smell out!<br /><br />My sister ordered the same one in PINK and it did not smell at all!

Here's why:<br /><br />1.  \\""Narrow at the top\\"" opening very inconvenient for loading large articles.<br /><br />2.  Steel mesh only extends half-way up the bag -- a thief could easily slash anywhere on the top half of the bag, including the top of the bag, and help himself to my stuff.<br /><br />3.  Exposed lobster-claw zipper-holds are easy for a pick-pocket to loosen... ironically, it's not so easy for you to feed the zipper holes onto the spring-loaded claw. (I.e., they are hard to use.) You could put a little lock to connect the top zipper pulls together, but the thief can still cut through the bag, and there is no way to lock the small zipper... thief can easily pull on it, slice the elastic holding the lobster-claw catch to the bag, and grab the goodies.<br /><br />4.  No chest or waist strap.  I consider this a security concern because it makes it much easier for the thief to get the bag off you in a drive-by or knock-over.<br /><br />5.  Bag loop at top of bag too small to fit hand into.<br /><br />6.  Soft plastic zippers... very easy to cut right through them or just yank them open.  Wouldn't want to wear this on a crowded Italian bus or subway.<br /><br />7.  In order to make the straps adjustable, the tougher material used for the shoulder straps ends under the padded area, where a foot of thinner, un-reinforced length of nylon webbing continues up the bag and through the looseners.  The padded part could have had wire in it, but doesn't.  All the thief has to do is grab the loose end of the webbing and cut through it, just below the loosener.<br /><br />So the \\""protection\\"" is dangerously illusory... this is no strong box.",15752.0

Here are my issues with this product.<br /><br />1. It SMELLS! strongly of latex. Think condoms or surgical gloves. I suspect that if left close to cloth items in your pack that it would give your clothes and thus you a latexy smell.<br /><br />2. It's too large wrapped up. This is mainly caused by the fact that it is three strands woven together vs. one, which is promoted as a way to hang clothes \\""without clothes pins\\"" in reality you can simply drape your clothes over a line. When drying indoors they won't blow away, so why use clothes pins anyways?<br /><br />3. The Velcro loop ends don't seem like an effective way of attaching the line to objects. Too bulky, and simple hooks would have worked better.<br /><br />4. When stretched out to \\""7 feet\\"" (Note, on the actual product it only claims a 6 foot capacity) it feels dangerous.

We did manage, but It took two people with the almost threat of it breaking the internal stretchy cover to get it out.  Once out, stuck in the dryer for 40 minutes with a dryer sheet, hoping the stench would go away, it didn't.  It heated the hulls, which was fine, but the smell continued.  We put it back in the cover, hoping that by morning it would be better: it was worse!<br /><br />I called bucky.com hoping for good customer support.  I was told that: 1.  the mullet NEVER smells (???) must be the problem of the way Amazon is holding the product. NO, the problem is that the hulls were rancid.  2. I was told that the cover is supposed to be an easy in/easy out....BS.  It was far easier to put the cover back on than to take it off, I will admit.

Nothing could have been further from the truth. The Metrosafe 200 is the most perfect design for a bag ever made. One cannot improve on perfection; this falls far short. The interior pockets which I use for my Ipod Touch and cell phone are secured in the 200 with velcro. In this  version, they're loose and unsecured. It appears to me that the alleged electrical protection consists of a small panel which forms the pocket- the same aforementioned pocket which I intended to hold the ipod. So now, my wallet is unprotected- the pocket is too small for a wallet anyway. The earbud hole has been moved to the rear top of the bag- if you carry a big Ipad and use it to listen to music (I don't) it would work. But it appears intended for a small Ipod Nano, Zune, or early ipod due to the presence of a 3 inch wide (but shallow) pocket at the top. This also is unsecured, and would seem to send the music device flying out the the bag upon opening. I suspect that ALL contents of this bag would fly out upon opening any part of the bag. This version also has no pocket behind the ipod/phone pockets- and its loss forms a bigger space in front, allowing for even more contents to freely fly out. I'm only giving this bag 2 stars- one for the presumed quality of the materials (based on experience) and one for the size. I would send this dud back, except that I'd already destroyed the box and packaging, based on my assumption that I was going to love it based on prior experience with this company. I need to add, that after time,  small wires start to poke out of the strap and start snagging clothing and causing skin abrasions. I took my Metrosafe 200 on a round-the-world trip and, other than the fabric coming apart around the zipper, it held up well and was amazingly well-designed. It fit its purpose better than could be expected- whcih is why I'm so disappointed with this offering from the company.<br /><br />2/1/2013 I just removed one of the stars. I unzipped it to pay for something, and both my wallet and checkbook came tumbling out. Not only that,  but it occurred to me after writing the initial review that there is no small zippered pocket (as the metrosafe 200 had) to keep important small things. I am currently seeking a \\""kangaroo keeper\\"" in order to sew in what is missing in this product. As it is, this product is not safe for daily use.<br />3/8/2014  The zipper just broke.  The teeth are fine, but about an inch of the fabric separated from them and the zipper pull came disconnected. It appears the disconnecting fabric problem which plagued my Metrosafe 200 has been fixed. On a different note: my cell phone works great while in the alleged anti-frequency pocket, so it obviously isnt EMP-safe. No idea what frequencies this pocket is supposed to block.",15734.0

Stay AWAY from zippered bags and force luggage manufacturers to start making more secure luggage. I keep thinking of green army duffle bags but let's face it.

Pack them into your carry on or better yet, backpack you can lay next to your feet and feel it at all times. I am learning to pack junk clothes and things such that if my whole bag is stolen it won't ruin my trip. Train yourself to resist dressing up on vacations.

My bags Falling Tree artwork is printed on some kind of green tinted plastic that is very tacky and cheap looking compared to the high quality fabric stitching shown in their photo.  There is some kind of hardened yellowish goo smeared on the print in several places also.  The artwork has blurry edges, lacks the detail shown in their photos, is blotchy in places, and is very unattractive.  I wanted the purse shown in the photo, but this is clearly not what Sherpani is selling.<br /><br />The bag also had a noticeable odor and am not sure if it was the ink for that plastic print or the bag materials.  The brown \\""leather\\"" in the photo looks slightly glossy with a rich brown color compared to the bag I received which has a matte very dark brown color.  There is a magnetic button that closes the purse and I saw that the finish on it that was already flaking off when I was packing it up for return to Amazon.  I feel very mislead by what Sherpani is showing in the product photos compared to what they are actually selling.  Shame on them.<br /><br />I can only assume that at some point Sherpani either changed manufacturers or made a decision to use cheaper materials on their products as I am finding recent complaints on other Sherpani products about the artwork printed on these bags/purses.  I am very curious if the previous reviewers had the green tinted plastic artwork like I received or if their bags were like the ones in the photos.<br /><br />I will upload a customer photo to show the discrepancy between their photo and the bag I received.

The Dopp kit had been a good product for me over the years, however, I found I didn't use all of the space that the Dopp kit provided.  Wanting to utilize space more efficiently (IE; take a smaller bag on trips), put me on a search for a smaller toiletry bag.  Naturally, I thought the Overnight Essentials bag on Amazon.com listed at 11x7x3 (product description), would be a perfect replacement.<br /><br />When the Overnight Essentials bag arrived, I found I couldn't get half of the toiletries I normally carry into the Overnight Essentials bag.  My first thought was that I measured my old Dopp kit incorrectly.  After double checking the measurements of the Dopp kit (which were correct), I then proceeded to measure the new Overnight Essentials bag.  I found the Overnight Essentials bag measured 8x5x2.  A LOT smaller than the Amazon.com description of 11x7x3.  I then looked on the back of the Victorinox placard card attached to the top of the kit itself and even Victorinox's description includes the measurements of 8x5x2.  So, I'm not sure where the 11x7x3 in the Amazon.com Overnight Essentials bag came from.<br /><br />The Overnight Essentials bag looks like it's a well made bag - as is all of my Victornox luggage and accessories - it just isn't as described by Amazon.com - hence the one star rating.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have replaced the Amazon.com Overnight Essentials bag with the Victorinox Hanging Toiletry Kit which I purchased at a local REI store.<br /><br />Ironically, The Victorinox Hanging Toiletry Kit is also incorrectly described on Amazon.com as 11x7x3.  The Victornox Hanging Toiletry Kit actually measures 9.75x9x3.75 - as stated on the attached Victorinox placard card.<br /><br />IMHO, inexcusable Amazon.",15725.0

Please do not let the high ratings for this bag fool you - the leather bleeds, and will stain your clothes permanently.  I have owned this bag (the brown version) for a week and a half, and on 2 light pairs of khaki pants that I must have worn with the bag on over the right pocket for 20 minutes for each pair total, I noticed an unsightly, diffuse brown stain.  The leather bleeds, and it bleeds badly.  I took it to the cleaners, who tried everything they could, and they told me they couldn't do anything to get the entire stain out.  I was shocked, as I have had stains of all sorts before, and this is the first time a stain could not be removed.

I am shocked at the high ratings, but can only conclude that the people with the high ratings are either not noticing their stains, are in fact getting better products (i.e., I got a lemon, unlikely considering I read just now some one stars about leather bleeding), or they are only using it with dark pants.

When we opened the first suitcase, we found that the manufacturers tag was not attached and was simply lying loose in the box.  We also noticed that the plastic protective coating that is supposed to be removed after purchase was already removed in all but a few places.  When we opened the case, we found that one of the straps that are supposed to hold the clothes in the side of the case was not properly attached (this strap is critical because the suitcase is a 'clamshell' style, opening in the middle with 2 equal halves to fill with clothes rather than opening on an end -- without the strap, the clothes simply fall out when the suitcase is opened).  Clearly this case had been purchased by someone else, returned as defective, and simply put back in a box and resold as new.  We then opened the second suitcase; it had the plastic protective coating half-removed and one of the manufacturers' tags removed and lying loose in the box.  When we tried to use the suitcase, we found that the handle was loose and wiggly, and would not lock in the lower position, which is exactly the position needed to pull the suitcase by an 8-year old.  Thus, out of 2 suitcases with different patterns, both had been returned as defective and resold as new.  Thus, both of these suitcases are being returned -- again.

In fact, three years after I bought it, I left a glowing review of it here that I ended with the following: &#34;When my bag wears out (and with the exception of a white/red spot from when I accidentally dropped it onto some heavy duty cleaning solution, I doubt it ever will), I will come right back to Amazon and buy another one.&#34;<br /><br />Sure enough, I ended up replacing it in November 2014, only when there was a hole in the bottom big enough for my 3DS XL to slip through.

I started to understand why so many of the reviews for this bag had complained about quality control.

After all, maybe I'd just gotten a random faulty bag -- luck of the draw, and all that.<br /><br />In late March 2016 -- i.e., not more than a month ago -- I purchased a new bag.  Barely three weeks later, it is literally disintegrating.  Not only that, but it sheds fine black dust all over everything I put in it.  This means that any time I reach into my bag for anything (which is often since, ya know, my bag is where I keep the stuff I need), I get black dust under my fingernails that is nearly impossible to remove without washing my hands.  I don't care a WHOLE lot about my physical appearance, but if I were sitting next to someone on the train and they had black soot under their fingernails after reaching into their bag, I'd be a little grossed out.  I tried wiping the inside of the bag with a damp washcloth, nothing works.  I'd throw it in the washing machine if I weren't so sure it'd completely fall apart in there.<br /><br />Don't buy this bag.

Google OPEN LUGGAGE PEN and watch the shocking video. You would be better off buying Lewis N. Clark Tsa Lockdown Triple Security Cable Lock also sold here at Amazon.com. The principle is by securing your zipper handles to the top suitcase handle the thief cannot close the zipper once he opens your bag with a pen. Always carry your valuables with you in your carry-on. Leave your jewelry at home and take cheap immitations. You can take aboard a backpack and a carry-on luggage. I once took carried an additional 50 pounds this way. BE prepared. There are lots of crooked baggage handlers, opportunistic passengers, and sticky-fingered TSA agents.<br /><br />Addenum: I have invented a way to deter thieves with pens. Take an awl and make two holes through your luggage fabric right next to where your two zippers rest after you zipper your bag closed. From the inside insert the cable's end through the hole and back in through the second hole. Now lock it from the inside. Use the second lock to lock the two zippers and the first cable together. If they open your luggage with a pen they cannot close it and you will discover the crime. The thief will know he can't close it so will not try. Now need to brainstorm how to keep the dirty TSA agent out. They worse than Al Queda! Maybe make a 2-3 foot long cable with loops at both ends at Home Depot. String your shirts, pants, shorts, sandals, etc. and lock them to the cable lock inside the luggage. They can open it but can't steal your clothes. Just carry the rest of your valuables in your carry-on. Try buying a Samsonite Cruisair luggage. It has NO zippers and a built in 3-number dial a combo. Hope all this helps.

UPDATED,"I searched long and hard for the perfect bag to be my daily carrier back and forth to the office. This bag had it all. Velcro closer with full zipper closure if desired. Expandable side drink compartment that zips closed when not in use. Inside there are pockets for my iPad, Macbook Pro 13\\"", chargers, cards, ID's, and the appropriate amount of zippers and pockets for accessory items. The only complaint I have, and the reason for only 4 stars, is the shoulder strap. First, I wear the bag on my left hip, which makes the pockets and features of the strap useless, as they are on my back. Second, the padded part that goes over the shoulder makes an unfortunate squeaking sound when walking similar to a leather on leather grinding noise. I'm hoping this is just because it's new, but I doubt it. It's annoying enough that I may eventually have to replace the strap (which won't be easy since one end is sewed on).<br /><br />In summary: awesome bag, slightly annoying strap. I'm keeping it!<br /><br />UPDATE<br />After using the bag for a couple weeks, the issue with the strap is worse than ever! With a little weight in the bag (i.e. a computer) the sound is so bad I'm considering returning the bag. Every time I put it over my shoulder it sounds like I'm wearing the world's worst pair of tight, sticky, leather pants. It's a bummer, because the bag itself is awesome.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/27/13<br />The strap noise only got worse. I even had a seamstress look at it to see if it could be altered. Thinking it might be the padding, she removed it. That only made it worse. The squeak is so loud I'm embarrassed to carry it through the office. Now, the interior pocket is tearing as well. The bag is now useless and un-returnable. Unfortunate, because I liked this bag. Down to 1 star.",15708.0

As there was still intact plastic underneath, I chalked it up to poor baggage handling and covered it with duct tape. I've just returned from my second trip with this luggage. When lifting the largest on my way to the airport, the metal holding the handle  twisted and came off, and the plastic/leather holding the strap to the case showed tearing along the rivets and a sharp point of metal was sticking out alongside the rivet. I was able to rig the metal piece back on with the creative application of some pliers, reattaching the handle for me to be able to get it back home. I covered the sharp metal point with duct tape (again) so no one would be hurt handling it. When it emerged from baggage claim, the handle was again detached. At this point I am giving it up for lost cause. There is clearly a reason this set is so affordable, and I am very disappointed with my purchase.",15707.0

Chances are, if you are buying this for a laptop that is 15.6 inches or less in size, you will get it and love it.  It has a retractable handle to make hauling your computer easy, and it will hold plenty of stuff besides.  It also has spinners (as opposed to inline wheels) to make things even easier yet.  It seems to be sturdy (though I cannot vouch for that from personal experience, as I have not actually used the bag extensively).<br /><br />One other reviewer (another one star review) complained that it would not fit in the overhead bin, so that is something else that you may wish to consider before purchasing this.

Interestingly, the packaging still shows a picture of the original scale and lists the 72 lbs capacity, but the product inside is the cheaper Chinese version.  The clam shell was redesigned to accomodate the slightly different shape of the new item but the manufacturer didn't bother to change the graphic card that fits inside the clam shell.<br /><br />I have had great success with the original as it has been very durable and accurate. A quick way to tell the new from the original is that the original has a yellow knob in the center of the dial that is used to manually reset the marker. The new cheaper version has a black knob. I will try to post a picture of the new one.",15681.0

The main reason I purchased it was because I had an older Mobile office bag from Samsonite which looked almost identical to the new bag. The quality of the old bag was superb with basically weekly use for years and the only reason I decided to purchase a new bag was that the wheels were beginning to sqeak a bit. Well, the new bag arrived promptly from Amazon and it looked great, I was happy but as it turned out that didn't last long. The first thing to break was the handle, within a few weeks it would no longer lock except when fully extended or all the way closed. Next, the wheels began to clog with all sorts of stuff including hair, the wheels are like long hair magnets and for some reason it gets caught up in the hub. Can't tell you how many times I cut away hair with a razor, but wait, there's more. Next the wheels started to disintegrate, I kid you not, they are falling apart today. The bottom of the bag, in the center back portion has also rubbed the ground to the point that it is falling apart, basically you cannot put much weight in it either. All in all, I would not purchase this bag again under any circumstances and I am considering contacting Amazon's customer service to see if there's anything I can do here. The bag is dead in only 6 months. As a recommendation, I would consider other products with good reviews first.",15679.0

It's a bit bigger than I wanted, but that wasn't reason enough for me to send it back. Love the leather quality especially.<br />Unfortunately, the lame nylon strap is a total joke - and is reason enough for me to send it back. Not only is the nylon strap of the cheapest quality/material you might see on one of these bags, but it's also too short... way too short. At maximum length, it still doesn't hang comfortably, but rather too high - it looks and feels more like a ladie's purse than a man's messenger bag due to this. And to make matters worse, the strap is sewn into the bag on one side, so it can't even be replaced with another strap. I happen to have a nice leather strap that matches the bag well enough, from one of my older bags, I would have happily switched onto it and kept the bag for (although I do think this bag should come with a much nicer strap without having to have it replaced) but even this option is ruined by the genius idea to sew the strap into the bag on one side. Quality, attractive leather bag - worthless, junky leather strap... sewn together. Whatever designer came up with that brilliant idea truly deserves a substantial raise and bonus.<br />As far as I'm concerned, having worn these sort of bags for more than twelve years, the shoulder strap is the most important part of the bag - or one of the most at very least. If the bag isn't comfortable, it isn't worth wearing. An unusually short shoulder strap made of uncomfortable nylon, the side of which digs into your neck as you're carrying it, is not comfortable or worth wearing.<br /><br />Sending mine back.<br />D.<br /><br />I'm sending it back.",15675.0

When it arrived in Bombay, one of the handles on the bag had torn off on one side and there was a a tear in the skin on one side of the bag.  The rivet had already torn through the fabric on the other side of the handle and it would only take a slight pull to remove it entirely.  I had it sewn instead of rivet and a patch put on the tear.  The patch and handle held through our trip, but when it arrived back in the States, still under the 23 kilo limit, both handles had been ripped off (the cobbler's repairs stayed intect--it ripped of right above them) and there was another tear in the bag.

This item, my latest, I bought to replace an earlier Delsey purchase that simply didn't last. I travel occasionally (domestically) for business (4-6 times/year) and (domestically and internationally) for pleasure (4-6 times/year). And, like many other travelers, I have learned from my most recent airline experiences that travelers often check their bags to their detriment -- poor bag handling and misplaced or lost luggage. Thus, I carry-on more than 90% of the time, packing lean in the process. Because my bags are seldom handled by anyone but me, I expect more longevity of my bags due to less wear and tear. Simply put, Delsey bags don't hold up. I have owned 3 Delsey, rolling carry-on bags in the last 10 years or so, and my wife has owned 2 Delsey bags. Our first two Delsey bags held up remarkably well, considering the low prices we paid for them. I wish that I could say the same for our last three bags. I have used my current bag -- this bag I am reviewing -- exactly 5 times since buying it in August 2012. I have traveled with it from Denver, CO to (1) Portland, OR, (2) San Francisco, CA, (3) Baltimore, MD, (4) Washington, DC and (5) Barcelona, Spain. After each trip, the bag has shown more wear and tear than I deem acceptable. The fabric is fraying throughout. The inner lining has ripped in two places. The rivets on the newly-designed handle are loose, and the fabric around the rivets is ripping and fraying around the eyelets. I feared this handle design change as soon as I bought the bag, and I have realized those fears. One major annoyance/defect I have observed since buying the bag is that the telescoping handle never extends the entire length the first time I release it from its locked position. Instead, the handle catches, mid telescope, such that I have to depress the thumb lock again in order to extend it fully. Because of this defect, I have dropped my bag several times during this extension process --a handful of times in the jet way as I exit aircraft in the mad rush to deplane -- which, as you may imagine, causes walking collisions and delays as passengers stack up behind me upon exit of the cattle cars we all fly in today. Finally, my bag -- when fully packed but not zipper-expanded -- doesn't fit into the overhead storage of many common planes. Specifically, my bag is difficult to fit into Boeing 777 and 757 overhead storage, because the depth of the bins is too shallow to accommodate it. It does however fit into Airbus 300-series planes (Airbus 319s and 320s) which have deeper overhead storage bins. So, do not over pack this Delsey bag, especially by unzipping the expandable area, and expect your bag to fit into most overhead bins. It won't fit easily or sometimes at all. Also, don't put any items -- like your bagged liquids -- in the external pockets, unless you want to rip the pockets (pocket stitching and pocket zippers) on the front side of the bag or the rubber suitcase protectors from on the backside of the bag.",15661.0

I bought this luggage specifically for a trip to Europe, as my existing luggage was over 10 years old and starting to show the frame through the fabric on the corners. I thought hard luggage would be more durable. Boy, was I wrong! As other reviewers have mentioned, it smells. I expected this so I aired the luggage out for a couple of weeks. This was no big deal.

I had to have it wrapped to get it from Paris to Minsk, where it stayed, too fallen apart to actually be used as luggage. The second piece lasted slightly longer, but started coming apart at the seams after the second leg of the journey. Plastic wrap kept this piece together for the next few flights. Finally, the small piece lasted much longer (probably since I was using it as a carry-on and handling it gently after the disasters with the other two pieces), but the entire thing split in half when placed into the back of a cab, heading to the airport to finally go home. I had to borrow a roll of duck tape from the hotel to quickly wrap it up, and that's how it got home.

Went into sale invoice and found out that since I bought it more than a month I'm screwed.  I really liked this product but what good is it when the seller doesn't back it up.

Before I bought this bag I had a Travelpro Crew 3 bag. It was decent for the price, I got almost 7 years out of it but had to replace the handle, wheels, and the top clip that holds the hook. Not bad for a 90 dollar bag.<br /><br />As for the Crew 8, what a rolling piece of garbage. I take some of the responsibility for buying it over the internet without a thorough examination, but I thought they would have had time to make some refinements going from Crew 3 to Crew 8. I was SO wrong. The Crew 8 is actually a lot worse and here's why:<br /><br />*The Crew 3 had a toiletries bag that snapped into the interior. The Crew 8, not so much.<br /><br />*The Crew 3 had plenty of zipper pockets to store your loose change, passport, etc. The Crew 8 just has one big one inside the lid, plus these stupid mesh/zipper/elastic things on the interior which don't actually give you the ability to STORE anything, only stuff a few pairs of socks into.<br /><br />*The Crew 3 had a pocket on the back of the bag (the side facing forward as you roll it). The Crew 8, nada.<br /><br />*The Crew 3 had a nice STRONG, THICK, METAL HOOK for you to hook another bag to when you roll it. The Crew 8 has a pathetic, extremely THIN GAUGE hook that is only slightly thicker metal than a darned COAT HANGER. The metal at the bottom of the hook broke in half after less than 2 weeks of use.<br /><br />*The Crew 3's STURDY HOOK had a nice THICK STRAP attached to it that could be easily adjusted to the proper length to tow your stuff. The Crew 8's WIMPY HOOK had a PATHETIC LITTLE VINYL STRAP that won't stay in place. That's right, you slide it to where you want it, then you walk about 50 feet and then look back to see that whatever you have attached to the hook is dragging on the ground because the strap won't stay in place and keeps slipping every time you readjust it.<br /><br />*The Crew 3's handle extended to one position. There was just the one option. The handle either locked fully up or fully down. The Crew 8's handle can be extended to two different lengths. Surely a plus, right? Well, not if the lower position is too low and the higher position is too high. I used to be able to rest my computer bag on top of the suitcase and grasp both of their handles at the same time. Now neither handle position allows me to do that comfortably. Nice job Travelpro.<br /><br />In summary let's just say that it's obvious that the quality of Travelpro bags has gone down. The old Crew 3 blows away this new Crew 8, and the old Crew 3 wasn't anything to write home about to begin with. It was just good enough. It was a bag that could have been really good if they had just spent $10 or so on upgraded parts during the manufacturing process. The Crew 8 is beyond help. It is poorly designed, cheaply made, and frankly it's an insult to the traveling public. Do yourself a favor, buy something else. Heck, put your stuff in a trash bag and roll it around on a skateboard. You'd save some dough and it would probably be kind of fun to see all the looks you get in the airport.",15635.0

Great job.<br /><br />So the girlfriend and I opened the box and revealed the Kenneth Cole briefcase.  At first glance it looked fantastic.  I was ready to tell my her, \\""Told you so!\\""<br /><br />But taking a closer look, it was obviously repaired in the top corner on both sides before it was shipped.  Cheap spot patches on each side so it could be sold.  Looks like this was part of a 2nd or 3rd quality run of briefcases that couldn't be sold in stores so were sold them online cheap.<br /><br />But it was really discounted from that $250 pice!  So I can handle a little ding that was repaired.  Otherwise the case looks great...except...hold on...<br /><br />...what just happens when I lift the case up by the handle?  Wow, the handle squeaks when I move it--if I barely move it.  And not just a little squeak when I lift up the case.  I tried to walk with the case and...SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK!  The handle squeaks so loud it is unbearable.  I'd look like an absolute idiot walking down the street with this thing.  My girlfriend was laughing so hard at this.  Again, another manufacturing flaw that no quality inspector could miss-clearly a 2nd or 3rd quality run that they didn't want to throw away so they sold online cheap.  If that's what you're looking for - this is the product for you!<br /><br />I wanted to return it but my girlfriend won't let me.  She's making me keep it to remind myself not to buy a 'bargain' on Amazon because it will just be more low-quality garbage that shouldn't be sold in the first place.  Lesson learned.",15623.0

We did not have the opportunity to use the luggage until our vacation a few weeks ago.  We opted to use the 29\\"" and 25\\"" suitcases and were initially impressed with the quality of the luggage.  Unfortunately, this was to be short-lived.  After using the luggage, we observed the wheels were not large enough for the suitcases, therefore, the bottoms of the suitcases drag on the ground when the luggage is pulled on two wheels.  We would adjust the angle at which we were pulling the bags to minimize the dragging, but it still continued.  A few days into our trip, we decided to examine the bottom of the luggage.  Much to our dismay, we found the black fabric piping along the bottom of the suitcase had worn off to the point where we could see the metal piece that fabric was shielding.  Additionally, this metal piece had begun to pull away from the actual suitcase on the 29\\"" piece.  Afraid our luggage would not withstand the journey home, we had to resort to pulling the luggage on all 4 wheels to prevent the bottom of the suitcase from dragging on the ground.  Talk about inconvenient!  The 4 wheels do not pull evenly and we had to consciously push and pull the luggage around just to get the suitcases from Point A to Point B.<br /><br />I would also like to comment that upon receiving the luggage, we were examining the suitcases and noticed the pull handle of the 20\\"" suitcase was broken.  The handle would extend fully but would not close.<br /><br />We were incredibly disappointed with the quality and engineering of this product and would not recommend this purchase to anyone.  If the wheels were slightly larger, the bottoms of the suitcases would not drag on the ground, thereby pulling parts of the suitcase away.  Upon our return home, we took multiple pictures to document the damage and also photographed our suitcases when packed; they were not fully packed so the weight of the luggage would not contribute to the dragging suitcases. It's unfortunate that we will only get one use from each large suitcase due to the fact the bottom of the suitcases are now falling apart.  We will be in the market for a new set of luggage and WILL NOT be purchasing from this manufacturer.  Buyer beware.",15620.0

The bag is large but fills up fast and even with only a few items it seems to weigh a lot. Then the disappointment factor set in; I pulled it out of the car one day when arriving at school and the strap broke. It broke by means of the stitching falling apart where the strap attaches with the bag itself. I thought about returning it for a new one or a refund but decided it wasn't worth it. I sewed the strap back on to the bag itself and so far it's been going ok.

I bought this bag last October (11 months ago) and it has done me good, despite the fact that one of the wheels never really touched the ground (wound up being a three wheel spinner). It worked well for me until last week. One of the pins (or screws) that keep the retractable handle together came out, thus the hand was hooked on by one of the extensions, not both and I had to put a paper clip through the hole in order to get it to work okay. Even before this, the handle would not go down all the way (the bottom extension would get stuck in an up position).<br /><br />Anyways, I called support and they want me to ship it to them for them to evaluate the warranty on it. I think it's not good practice for a company to expect the customer to pick up the dime for shipping.

One such problem is that the leather straps that continue from the clips on the front of the bag continually curl upwards. I have tried rubber-banding them overnight and over the course of a few days to try and get the leather to set in the proper position, but it always seems to curl up again. There is another attorney in court that has this bag and he has the same problem. It may be annoying, but at least it is only cosmetic.<br /><br />The other problem is much worse. The clasps that lock the shoulder strap to the bag have a tendency to open and the bag then falls to the ground. This often happens after I have set the bag down in my car for the commute home. Unfortunately, my macbook was in the bag on one of the occasions in which the strap came unlocked and fell. This defective design caused the bag (and my macbook that was in it) to fall two or three feet to the sidewalk. The fall broke my macbook's logic board and now my usb drives do not work. I think it is understandable that I would be upset when my expensive macbook is broken because the bag was not tested enough or designed well. I know it is not a \\""laptop\\"" bag, but it is not uncommon for people to carry their laptops in bags of this kind. Moreover, it is just inconvenient and frustrating to be walking and have the strap come loose and the bag plummet to your feet.<br /><br />So let this review be a warning to anyone who is interested in buying this bag. Do not carry anything that is expensive or breakable in this bag.",15602.0

I'm new to college and I have a few books to carry around (few meaning 2-3 BIG books) so I thought a huge bag would fill in to that.<br />Sure, the bag is pretty big (first photo shows how big it is on me: [...]) I am 5'3\\"" by the way. I guess the size is okay with me, but there's just more to why I don't like it:<br />The bag is just plain heavy already by itself. Okay, I overreacted on that one, but compared to my Jansport bag with more pockets and space in it, this Everest bag feels like I'm already carrying stuff with me in it.<br /><br />Second, the little stuff that the straps go through look and feel really cheap: [...] I put on the flash to show that it's made from some cheap sort of plastic. It is also very hard to adjust the straps as to I'm the kind of person who likes to put on the bag and adjust it to my taste. We kind of have to push and tug for it to budge, and I have to do it gently in fear of it breaking.<br /><br />Third, one other reason I bought this bag is because they said they have side pockets. I'm the kind of person who, if I don't have the time to remove my bag and put in stuff, would shove it in the side pocket. I also like to carry water around and usually put it in there. My problem is that the side pocket zipper is a one-way zipper and it goes all the way from front to end [...], meaning if you try to open it, all the stuff that's in there would just fall out.<br /><br />Fourth, coming back to the reason of its' heaviness, I had only put my 13\\"" Macbook Pro with the casing in it and a notebook and it already felt like a ton. I decided to hand-carry in a plastic bag the remaining stuff because it feels like the bag would break and rip open.<br /><br />So with all my complains others would ask, 'why not return it?' For one, I am too lazy to; two, I feel like this bag would only do good with stuffing in clothes with it so I can tow it away with me whenever I go on vacation (which is rarely) and third, the style. I like vintage-y stuff.<br />Perhaps if I tire of these reasons, I might just give this to my local GoodWill donation center or if I'm too angry with it, just plain ol' throw it in the trash.third, the style.

Very hot day, heavy bag & a wonky wheel....just what I needed!<br /><br />So, as it was my 1st use of the bag...it was still in pristine condition (except for the wheel), I obviously thought the warranty would cover it.  Ah, but according to the service centre (stacked with broken bags) - the 'unlimited' warranty only actually covers faulty zips, stitching & faulty manufacture.  Just because my bag broke when I was using it for its intended purpose apparently doesn't constitute faulty manufacture!

Some might call me a road warrior. In those years I have purchased a good deal of luggage due to wear on the mechanisms and poor airline handling. I was so excited to find lightweight luggage for shorter distance trips just to save wear and tear on myself. This luggage has earned the distinction of being the most disappointing luggage purchase.<br /><br />I purchased this luggage a little over a year ago and can vouch for the fact that it is very lightweight and the frame seems to be holding up fine. The interior looks like new. However, after the very first use I noticed that the fabric was fraying, especially at the seams and on the piping. After several uses the luggage looked as though it had been through a war. Will it still hold clothes? Yes. However, the fabric now has fraying that measures up to 1 inch long in places. I tried using FrayCheck on it but it didn't help. The fabric has now worn so thin that I can't depend on it to protect my belongings any more and it is nearly impossible to zip a zipper without it getting caught in all the fraying.<br /><br />I checked with a luggage repair shop that does warranty work for Delsey. They told me that the warranty does not cover the fabric and said that these bags use polyester fabric which is known for this type of breakage in the fibers. They said that there is really nothing that can be done and that this fabric is known for breaking down. They have recommended that I purchase nylon luggage because the fabric is much more durable.<br /><br />Hopefully, this will help you avoid wasting hard-earned money on something that will have a very short life span.",15566.0

I hated the design of that bag. While it is light, it is much too flimsy to any kind of heavy duty use. Travelpro included a relatively cheap, but pretty design on the attachment strap and the short handle, both of which are sure to break with significant use. They've also rotated the axis of the long handle so as to make it harder to slide an extra bag over them. The front pockets are designed for appearance instead of utility, and so the zippers have a funny looking \\""U\\"" shape and the pockets actually overlap, while being too thin to really hold anything. The nylon is a thin weave designed to have a nice \\""shine\\"" instead of being resistant to damage.<br /><br />I had a chance to inspect this new version at a luggage store.  While different aesthetically, has all the same flaws, except that they have rotated the axis on the long handle back to where it should be.<br /><br />I later purchased a Travelpro FlightCrew4 20\\"" bag from an online store that caters to pilots and flight crew. What a bag! Nice sturdy ABS frame, real inline skating wheels, heavy duty handles with the axis in the correct direction, well-laid out pockets, padded laptop pocket, and heavy duty nylon -- and more than $40 cheaper!  If you want to ensure that you can carry it on, avoid the 22\\"" model, which is actually about 24\\"" in length including wheels and handles.<br /><br />I also own a Kirkland 22\\"" suiter (available only at Costco), which is better than this one and only $99.00.<br /><br />So, do yourself a favor: Skip anything in the Crew9 series (or any of Travelpro's consumer lines) and buy the FlightCrew4 from an online retailer or get the 22\\"" Kirkland at Costco.",15564.0

Sadly, the new Victorniox zip-around wallet was just as bad as everyone said.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find anyone today who carries it, so I got the new version at Macy's.  But this new version has a serious design flaw.  It is not balanced correctly.  The front wheels are too short (just look at the picture), so the bag wants to fall over both when it's standing, and when you are rolling it on all four wheels.  This problem is made much worse when you put a computer bag on top of it.  In that case, you can't leave it standing, but must find a wall to balance it against.  Even then, the wheels will sometimes roll out from under it, causing your bags to scrape the wall as they fall (left a gouge on my white closet door).  The previous version, which was balanced correctly, could be sent flying on its own down the hallway with a 30 pound computer bag, and never risk tipping.  You could even use it as a rolling crutch, unlike the current one which will tip and fall.<br /><br />Real shame.  Brand new bag, and now I'm shopping for a brand new brand.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I've used it now for dozens of trips since my last review (I travel extensively).  I've now gotten used to hearing the particular sound of the thud that the bag makes before I turn and see it lying face down on the floor next to me.  A few times when I've been running to reach a gate, it has spun and fallen over under my feet, nearly causing an embarrassing spill.  I've examined the front (short) wheels carefully to see if there is a way to raise them so that the bag will be properly balanced, but I cannot figure anything out.  I never had any of these problems with the prior Silhouette model.  I carry an electronic component that barely fits inside the bag, so I'm hesitant to buy another 21.5\\"" model online in case it doesn't fit.  Still, if anyone has any suggestions for a replacement bag, I'd be grateful.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I discovered that this bag will stand up on itsown (with a computer bag on top) if you push it away from you so that the wheels all point forward, but it is still tenuous.  If the wheels are pointed backward, it simply falls over.  However, I purchased the Victorinox Avolve bag, and it has none of the balance issues of this one while still having the interior dimensions that I need.

I own a Delsey garment bag and its super light.  I liked the suit compartment on this bag and the price seemed like a good value.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this bag has a severe design flaw.  The two handles (one on the side and one on top) are held on by two small screws on each side of the handle.  Most bags that I've owned have a rivet or other mechanism to keep the handle secured, this has small screws into small pieces of plastic.  On my very first trip with the new bag, it broke.  When I went to lift the packed bag onto the luggage scale at the airport, the handle came off in my hand.  The luggage only weighed 40lbs and I was not yanking it around.  It was obvious that the screws had stripped the plastic pieces and the handle could not be re-attached.  It was pretty frustrating moving this bag from car to hotel and back with no top handle.  I was surprised that the luggage handlers did not break the side handle either since it has the same design flaw.<br /><br />Overall a nice bag, but the handle design is so bad that I recommend not buying it.",15532.0

Airport to connecting flight<br />4. Connecting flight to final airport<br />5. Final airport to van and van to hotel<br />6. Hotel to bus<br />7. Bus to cruise ship (Yahoo!)<br />8. Cruise ship to bus (Blah!)<br />9. Bus to resort<br />10. Resort to taxi<br />11. Taxi to airport<br />12. Airport to connecting flight<br />13. Connecting flight to airport<br />14. Airport to car<br />15. Car to home :-(<br /><br />On step 8, I just about got my hand cut off.  The handles of the suitcases are kind of like a fabric tube, with a flat piece of metal through the tube.  Both ends tuck neatly into the the top of suitcase fabric, with the fabric being tucked in while the metal piece has holes in each end, secured to the suitcase with rivets.  It appears that one of the rivets did not hit the hole in the metal strap and they came apart.  When I grabbed it, the metal came out and just about sliced my hand open.  I fought this from step 11 above to step 15 and was reminded yesterday (2 months later) when my mom about cut her hand moving the suitcase in our spare room and grabbed the metal strap.<br /><br />I realize that warranty issues arise and sometimes mistakes are made in the manufacturing process; hence, the included warranty.  My main reason for the 1 star is because I didn't keep the small papers/cardboard pieces attached to the suitcase.  When I came home from the trip and was ready to try to get the warranty service, I could not find a website or any information on how to get to the warranty or contact the company.  I may have overlooked it, but I simply get the feeling that they did not want someone to easily warranty the product.  This was outside Amazon's return policy timeframe (two months after purchase), so that was not an option.  At this point, it looks like like I will have to drill out the rivets and secure the strap myself before I, or one of my family members, loses a hand.<br /><br />OK, so here it is in a nutshell.<br /><br />The Good:<br />-The storage compartments in the suitcases are spacious and the suitcase allows for zippered expansion (very nice touch).<br />-The inside of each suitcase is very nice, with a nice look.<br />-The wheels roll very well and the spinners are GREAT.<br />-The handles extend and retract with ease and they all seem to have a good, solidly sounding click when engaged.<br />-The outside of each suitcase is very clean cut, with nice lines.  They are very nice to look at and were easy to spot in the baggage return.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />-Stink, stank, stunk.....The interiors of the suitcases had a definite VOC smell to them, more so than I felt comfortable with knowing that my 4 year old was using one.  You need to let them air out before your trip and store them with a good spray of Febreeze and some air fresheners or laundry sheets.<br />-The handle broke and about de-handed me after only a few short days on the FIRST use.<br />-The warranty information and/or website was not readily found. (Still isn't found)Shame!<br /><br />I hope this helps.<br /><br />Good travels to all.Shame!<br /><br />I hope this helps.<br /><br />Good travels to all.",15523.0

Did not last!,"I bought two of these because our school district only allows clear backpacks and I was having a hard time finding them locally.  Two years before, I had bought whatever brand at Target for $15.  My older son used it for kindergarten and first grade.  The only problem we had with it was that the small mesh pocket got a tear in it from him putting something too pointy and big in it.<br />The K-Cliffs brand is a completely different story. The zippers on the main compartments started to fail about halfway through the school year.  The main compartment has two zippers so it can be zipped from either side.  One side failed, and for the third quarter of school, we were able to only zip the main compartment in one direction (not that big of a deal).  Then shortly after, the other zipper failed on both bags.  At some point during the fourth quarter of school, both bags got a couple holes in the bottom of the bag.  The apparently cheaply made plastic just cracked and got holes.  These backpacks were not put through any rigor by any means.  They were used by a kindergartener and a second grader.  No heavy toting going on here.  I take my kids to school every day and pick them up every day.  I give them their backpacks at the door to the school, and they give them back to me as soon as they come out of the school.  There's no dragging onto a bus or dragging on the sidewalk, but if you looked at the condition of them, that's what you'd think.<br />Meanwhile the Target backpack is still sitting around the house somewhere in perfectly good condition (except for the tear in the mesh pocket).  My younger son uses it to pack up all of his animals and small toys and drags it up and down our stairs.<br />I will never buy this K-Cliffs brand again!

We figured it was just a bit of bad luck.)<br />The customer service rep was dreadful. Since I did not have a receipt, I apparently needed to stipulate the day of purchase, in order to get a replacement (so that Brookstone could track down the actual till record at the store, I assumed.) This was the unyielding Brookstone policy, said the rep. Oddly enough, I could not recall the precise day I bought the neck pillow! Silly me, I should have marked my calendar specially.<br />The rep also said that a number of other customers had reported \\""issues\\"" with this wide mouth valve, which they - the customers - had resolved by biting hard on the valve.

THEY'RE DEFECTIVE.,"Downgraded mask rating from 4 stars to 1 star.<br /><br />I just received 3 more masks. About a year ago I bought a blue eye mask. I wanted to buy more but they were unavailable up until recently.  I read the 1 star reviews that stated that the ink bled.  Before washing, I test washed them in the sink. No bleeding so I washed the 3 new masks along with the 'old' blue mask in cold water. The blue mask has been cold water washed multiple times with no problems (but never machine dried).<br /><br />The new masks self-destructed in the cold water wash. ALL 3 MASKS ARE TOTALLY UNUSABLE. The old blue mask is just fine.<br /><br />The label on all (old and new) masks say \\""Lewis N. Clark\\"".<br /><br />=========================================<br /><br />ARRGGHHH!  Received replacement mask. I rinsed it by hand in cold water with mild soap. The filler (stuffing) 'melted' and shifted to one side.  It's going back.  Rats!  I really, really wanted another one.  On the bright side, the mask didn't bleed.<br /><br />========== ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW ========<br /><br />On my nose, some light creeps in the area next to my nostrils. If I darken the room then most of the light is blocked out.  The amount of light that comes in depends upon the shape of your nose; there's no way of adjusting the contour of the mask bottom.  If you're really, really sensitive to light then these might not work out for you.<br /><br />The fabric is plush and comfortable but the plushiness is like putting a down comforter on your eyes. If the room is warm, then your eyes will be even warmer but they're great in the winter.<br /><br />When your eyes are blinking, your lashes may touch the mask which can be annoying.  Of course, once you're asleep then that's not an issue.<br /><br />The mask strap stays in place on my head.  I had another brand which always slid off.<br /><br />I've had this pair for over a year and I still use them (when the room is cool) when I want to sleep during the daytime.",15509.0

Im only 5'5\\"" and the handle is quite long, so being able to stop the handle at the next notch down would be a good thing. It does not stay. A LOT of travel bags have this issue where it will stay for a little but, but give it a tug such as going over a curb, and it slips out. This NEVER stays at the desired level, so it is annoyingly too long.<br /><br />2. Getting in and out of the large compartment is a pain in the BUTT. You cannot just unzip it a little to get at what you want. So on a long flight you cant just reach into the overhead compartment unzip and pull out what you need. You have to take down the entire case.<br /><br />3. The other difficulty getting in and out of the main compartment is that the zipper snags on the sides. You have to keep pushing the material in, and it is very stiff. This zipper snag happens CONSTANTLY. There are buttons to release the fabric, but then you have this flap of fabric, so it is even more likely to get stuck.<br /><br />4.

This almost led to a very costly issue. Unsure how well light would be blocked in our hotel room on vacation, I packed my blue mask. I was having trouble getting to sleep and so as not to disturb hubby I moved to the couch in the other room of the hotel suite.

After five or six hand washes (no more than fifteen minutes), the mask will retain its black color, yet the dye will be washed out and you shouldn't experience blue streaks on your pillow case.  It took me a while to figure this easy solution out and I've made a mess of a number of hotel pillow cases. [UPDATE:]  After several weeks trying hard to like this Eye Mask, I must say the bleeding issue continues to be serious enough to make me give it \\""thumbs down\\"" and if I'm able, the one star rating will reflect my dissatisfaction.  Washing after washing have reduced bleeding evidence, but not enough so that blue streaks are 100% gone.  Too bad.  I really wanted to like this product.",15494.0

It's crazy that some luggage engineer designed this and their testers let it go into production. I sent it back but Tumi said it worked fine and wouldn't even exchange it.

If you check out my other reviews, you'll see why I won't be buying any more Eagle Creek products.  I said I wouldn't after my last bad experience, but I relented and gave them another chance.  That was my mistake.<br /><br />The main problem with this version of their tri-fold wallet is that there is a pocket which sits opposite the Velcro closure.  Over a short time it starts to wear, until ultimately the pocket becomes completely unusable.  Check out the photo I submitted for this product (one of the product photos).  It shows the hole in my wallet.<br /><br />This is a major design flaw, which could have been caught had they done ANY kind of basic product design testing.<br /><br />The rest of the wallet is a nice enough design, although it's a bit smaller than their earlier designs and credit cards no longer fit all the way in (again, maybe they should test this first).  And except for the bad pocket opposite the Velcro, the durability seemed improved.<br /><br />What a terrible disappointment it was then, to end up with this hole.<br /><br />Eagle Creek used to be a small company dedicated to making high quality products.

I figured I would just run it under water or maybe give it a quick wash with woolite like I do all my non color fast fabrics before I used it. After 5 or so HEAVY washes it was still bleeding dye like it was made of freakin' kool aid and it was starting to show that it was really just the olive bag with a shoddy dye job. Since there was no way I could return it anyways at that point, I started really aggressively trying to get the dye to stop rubbing off (and by rubbing off, I literally mean the bag could be completely dry and if you touched it, your finger would be dyed dark green). I used to work in a fabric store and as a costumer, so I tried every single trick I knew to make the fabric color fast (things that made even the loosest hand dyed fabrics stop bleeding color) but to no avail. Just when I thought I got it working I noticed when I looked down at my clothing after an hour or so, the bag had dyed it dark green as well.<br /><br />I don't exactly care all too much about a little dye rub off on my clothing, but after ruining the latest book I was reading, and dying the edge of my sketchbook that horrid dark green color, I'm officially just giving up on trying to fix it.<br /><br />The other colors might be fine, and I feel like if you really like the price of this bag and want something smaller then a computer bag, but not so small you can't carry some things with you, then go for the khaki/stone color and hope that you have better luck then I did.",15455.0

I had left a positive review here on Amazon under that particular bag, but now I have run into a problem with the bag, and Amazon will not let me edit my review as they are not selling the design that I purchased at the moment. Therefore, although the design of this one is different, the brand, size, and features (two front pockets, two side pockets) are all the same as the one I have, so I felt compelled to write another review and let fellow Amazon buyers know my issue with Rockland.<br /><br />As I noted previously, I purchased the duffle bag in late March 2011. I thought the bag was great, as all aspects of the bag seemed to be sturdy. However, no more than 6-8 uses, and less than one year later (on March 13, 2012), I was packing for a trip. I had eight shirts in the bag, went to pick it up to put my curling iron in it, and I heard a tear! Upon further inspection of the bag, I noticed that it had tore at the seam on the left side (a good size tear, I would say about 5-6 inches maybe). I went to the store and bought another bag for my trip, since I was in a hurry, I didn't have time to shop around for one that was comparable to the size of the Rockland duffle bag that had tore, but I thought \\""I'll suck it up and use the new one now even though its much smaller, and deal with the torn one when I get home, it has a warranty\\"".<br /><br />When I got home, I decided to try and take care of the problem, no big deal, right? WRONG! I contacted \\""Fox Luggage\\"" (apparently the makers of Rockland), and they emailed me the warranty claim form. On the form, it noted that I had to send them the bag back so they could \\""inspect it\\"" and ensure that it would be convered under warranty, along with $25 for handling. Well, I didn't expect them to ship me a new one without seeing what had happened to the one I had, and I didn't expect that they would ship me out another one for free either, but I thought $25 was outrageous seeing as to how the bag costed me $20 here on Amazon last year, and the same exact one that I have is on clearance at Target for $14.44 (as of 4/3/12)! I emailed them again and told them that such a warranty would only benefit someone who purchased one of their more \\""higher priced\\"" luggage sets, and it would do me, or anyone else that had purchased this duffle bag (or even the one with wheels) no good. It wasn't surprising that I never heard back from them.<br /><br />Now normally, I am NOT the type of consumer to \\""complain\\"", (particularly for a $20 product that I can now purchase for $14), but I was very disappointed in the way Fox Luggage handled this. The bag that I have has NEVER seen an airport, bus or train station, it has only seen the trunk of my car (6-8 times as noted previously). It still looks BRAND NEW (except for the tear on the side), and even smells brand new! Had I got a couple of years use out of it, and at least another 6-8 uses, I probably wouldn't be here, but I feel that I totally got ripped off, and their customer service was not very good either. So much for the compliments on my bag, I wonder how many I will get now that I tell everyone that Rockland (Fox Luggage) was so unhelpful.<br /><br />In closing, I truly wish companies would not boast about their \\""warranty\\"" unless they are willing to [fairly] follow through with it for each customer who purchased their product. Regardless of whether the bag was $500 or $14, it's only fair that the company ensure that regardless of how much each customer spent on their product, they have a fair opportunity to make use of the warranty that is given should they need to. But, I guess according to Fox Luggage (Rockland), only those who purchase higher priced products are worthy of being able to fairly take advantage of their warranty-what a shame. I will never purchase another Fox Luggage product again, and I will be sure to share my personal experience and opinions about Fox Luggage (Rockland) to anyone who is willing to listen. I went ahead and purchased the same bag again from Target for $14, but I will be returning it tomorrow as I will not knowingly support a company that makes a 3 year warranty one of their major selling points, and instead uses it to disadvantage its consumers a second time.",15434.0

I did not buy a Victornix, but looked at one in a high-end luggage store.<br /><br />24 hours after writing my initial review, I am reducing my rating of the Kenneth Cole suitcase from 4 stars to 1 star, and I am returning it to amazon.com, with very mixed feelings.  I still give the Samsonite suitcase a 4 star rating, for what it is, and given its relatively low price.  Even so, I have returned the Samsonite Bright Lites for an upgrade to the \\""Samsonite Silhouette 12 30\\"" Hardside Spinner Luggage,\\"" which I give a 5 star rating.<br /><br />The reasons and my impressions of the Kenneth Cole Reaction, Samsonite Bright Lites, and Samsonite Silhouette12 suitcases are very different.<br /><br />These suitcases are similar in that they are modern \\""hard shell\\"", light weight, large suitcases with four swivel wheels on one end in a so-called \\""spinner\\"" configuration, and a telescoping/retractable handle at the other end.  In addition, there are two simple carrying straps, one at the handle end, and one in the middle (with reference to the length) on one of the longer edges.  The interiors are rather simple, without a lot of pockets and compartments (which also keeps the weight down).  In a general sense, these suitcases share an identical design approach, which has advantages and disadvantages, briefly discussed below.  Clearly there are compromises involved.<br /><br />At this point I should mention (relevancy below) that I was in the market for at least one new suitcase after airline baggage handlers knocked a wheel off my 14-year-old old-style large Samsonite suitcase, essentially destroying it.  (My stay away was for a week, and so I had time to order and receive the Kenneth Cole as a replacement.)<br /><br />I'll first discuss the design approach which these suitcases have in common, with advantages and disadvantages compared to the older style hard shell suitcases.  A big advantage is light weight, important now because the airlines impose a surcharge for suitcases weighing over 50 pounds.  These new suitcases weigh approximately 10 pounds.  I did not weigh my old one before I discarded it, but I would guess it weighed 15 pounds or more.  That is significant because usually I could not pack my old suitcase full without exceeding the 50-pound limit.<br /><br />Although these suitcases have plastic hard shells, rather than fabric, the two sides are closed by a zipper, and not latches, which undoubtedly contributes to the light weight.  Thus, there is no rigid structure where the two sides are joined (and the plastic sides are relatively flexible).  As a result, when picking up a loaded suitcase by one of the strap handles, there is considerable flexing of the plastic material, and force transmitted through the zipper.  I would guess the zippers are strong enough to withstand this force, but the flexing is somewhat disconcerting to see.  Also, without a rigid structure where the two sides are joined, the strap handles are off center.  So, when picked up by a strap handle, the suitcase does not hang straight down.<br /><br />I personally do not care for the four swivel wheels on one end in a so-called \\""spinner\\"" configuration.  Whatever advantage there is (ability to roll through a narrow space) outweighs, in my view, the disadvantage compared to my old hard shell suitcase which had only two somewhat recessed wheels.  I mentioned above that I bought the Kenneth Cole and Samsonite suitcases after airline baggage handlers knocked a wheel off my 14-year-old old-style large Samsonite suitcase.  The four wheels on the new \\""spinner\\"" style protrude much farther than the partially recessed wheels of my old Samsonite suitcase, and it appears are more vulnerable to being knocked off.  Here's the rub:  The warranty on the suitcases basically covers manufacturing defects, and expressly excludes coverage for damage caused by airline baggage handling.  On the other hand, the airline contract of carriage stares that the airline \\""is not liable for damage to protruding baggage parts like wheels, straps, pockets, retractable and pull handles, zippers, hooks or other items attached to baggage.\\""  Bottom line, the customer takes the risk in the event the airline baggage handlers knock the wheels off.  That happened to me with wheels that seemed to be far less vulnerable.<br /><br />Now for the significant differences.<br /><br />While I generally like the \\""new\\"" smell of something new, the Kenneth Cole Reaction has an extremely strong chemical odor apparently from the plastic material.  I myself am not chemically sensitive.  (I have several friends who are chemically sensitive and likely would be physically knocked out by the smell.)  Even so, I could not tolerate being in the same room with the new Kenneth Cole Reaction suitcase when I unboxed it.  (On another website a reviewer mentioned this.)  The odor was so strong I could taste it on my tongue.  I have no way of knowing for sure, but I suspect the outgassing of the plastic is toxic to some degree.  Fortunately, the place where I was staying had a closet where I could stash the suitcase until it was time to pack to go home.  I've left the suitcase open and on my screened porch for 24 hours now, and the chemical odor is just as bad.  This fatal flaw in execution is tragic in a way, because the Kenneth Cole Reaction suitcase has a great appearance and an excellent overall design.  I really wanted to keep it because it looks so good and has a well-designed interior.<br /><br />There is no particular adverse odor to the Samsonite Bright Lites and Samsonite Silhouette 12 suitcases.<br /><br />The difference may be in the material.  The Kenneth Cole Reaction is made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS).  The Samsonite Bright Lites is made of polycarbonate, as is the Victorinox Luggage Spectra.  I really do not know specifically what causes the chemical odor of the Kenneth Cole Reaction.<br /><br />Related to the material, the Kenneth Cole Reaction has two layers, perhaps laminated.  The visible outside is blue.  Inside (hidden by the lining, but accessible via a zipper) plastic is grey. Accordingly, a gouge or a scratch deep enough to go through the blue layer is going to show the grey underneath.  Likewise, the Samsonite Silhouette 12 suitcase appears to have two layers, perhaps laminated; the outside of mine is dark red, but inside (hidden by the zippered lining) the plastic is dark, almost black.  So, again, a gouge or a scratch deep enough to go through the dark red layer is going to show the black underneath. (That hasn't happened to mine, yet.)  The plastic of the Samsonite Bright Lites (and I believe of the Victornix as well) is solid color all the way through, so any scratches are not going to show a different color.<br /><br />The Kenneth Cole Reaction and the Samsonite Silhouette 12 each have a textured surface, with a very nice appearance.  As it is inevitably marred during use, it probably would continue to look good, provided a scratch or gouge does not go all the way through to the different-colored underlayer.<br /><br />In contrast, the Samsonite Bright Lites is a very shiny blue, covered by a plastic film to be pulled off before actual use.  That itself should be a tip off.  The manufacturer at least wants the suitcase to look good when initially received by a customer.  Quoting another reviewer: \\""The shiny finish looks great at first, but now after only one trip, the entire case is scuffed and dull.\\""  One could accept that disadvantage, under the guise of character or patina.  At least the color will remain.<br /><br />Regarding appearance, I prefer the Kenneth Cole Reaction.  However, when odor is taken into account, that eliminates the Kenneth Cole Reaction.  The appearance of the Samsonite Silhouette 12 is also very good.  The Samsonite Bright Lites looks somewhat cheap, and in fact costs half as much as the Samsonite Silhouette 12.<br /><br />For interior construction, the Samsonite Silhouette 12 has the clear edge.  Both sides have a zippered mesh cover panel that completely contains whatever is placed on that side.  The suitcase can be packed, either side folded over and closed, and nothing falls out.  In addition, there is a waterproof clear plastic compartment for wet things.  The Kenneth Cole Reaction is also very good in this regard.  In particular, the side which may be considered the lid has a zippered mesh cover panel that completely contains whatever is placed on that side.  The Samsonite Bright Lites is dismal in its interior arrangement.  There is a divider panel held in place by two straps, but there are gaps on the sides.  Large folded items of clothing are held in place okay, but smaller items, such as rolled-up socks, are prone to falling out.  More care in packing is required.  Small loose items need to be in the bottom side.<br /><br />There is no lock on the Kenneth Cole Reaction.  Both Samsonite suitcases (and also the Victornix) have a TSA lock (customer sets a combination; TSA has a key) which captures the zipper pulls.  I suppose the lock would provide a measure of security against casual pilfering, but mainly the lock ensures that the zipper does not inadvertently open.  I personally am not concerned about the lack of a lock on the Kenneth Cole Reaction.<br /><br />The Samsonite suitcases seems significantly larger than the Kenneth Cole Reaction.  Depending on the trip, that size is important.  With the relatively light weight, a lot can be packed into it without exceeding 50 pounds.  The Samsonite suitcases do weigh about 2 or 3 pounds more than the Kenneth Cole Reaction.<br /><br />After weighing all the factors, I have upgraded to the \\""Samsonite Silhouette 12 30\\"" Hardside Spinner Luggage.\\""  Once I got over initial \\""sticker shock\\"" I decided the quality was worth it.  The Samsonite Bright Lites is a good value for what it is.  The Kenneth Cole Reaction is completely unacceptable due to its strong and offensive odor, a fatal flaw in an otherwise excellent design.  I expect the Victorinox Spectra is a fine suitcase, but a bit too pricey, and I personally do not care for the appearance.  I prefer textured to a shiny surface.<br /><br />As a final comment, I like the Samsonite Silhouette 12 so well that I ended up buying a nested set of three sizes [[ASIN:B004IYJXJS Samsonite Luggage Silhouette 12 Hs 3 Pc Nest (Sp22/26/30) Wheeled Luggage]].",15433.0

Since there were none close to Los Angeles, CA ???? I would have to pay for them myself plus shipping!!! I said, What about the warranty? Sorry, can't help you. Service center or nothing. 2nd trip my husband took. Bag came back with the back (cheap cloth) ripped from the bottom plastic section. All the way across the back. That won't last one more trip. Geez what a piece of garbage! The 21\\"" Atlantic bag from the 90's (low end line) he was using before, lasted for 3yrs of weekly traveling with No sign of ware. Samsonite has a lot of nerve treating paying customers so shabby. especially since they must know their luggage is not going to hold up through the baggage claim process.",15431.0

This garment bag looks great, but touch it with a feather and it'll fall apart.<br /><br />First thing to go was the rubber on the hooks that hold the bag on a door.  The hooks themselves are awful -- even with the rubber they barely work, the angle is off and easily slips off.  There are 2 hooks, one on the flap that opens up for dual support, that hook is permanently attached to the bag and once the rubber falls off, it's useless.  If you put something like cardboard or whatever under it to stop it from marring a door, it falls off.<br /><br />Whatever is under the fabric has the durability of cardboard.  As I was packing for a 2nd trip, I noticed where the primary hook is attached to the top is now warped from the weight of the bag when hanging.  Makes zipping the bag up an adventure.<br /><br />My previous garment bag was a Tumi, which I've come to appreciate even more.  I had it for 20 years and it held up amazingly well -- but after all this time I find I need something with wheels -- the Tumi equivalent is around $800.  If you're a heavy packer, you'll get about 6 trips out of this bag before it falls apart.  Doing the math that way, the Tumi is a deal.",15424.0

Arrived quickly and upon first glance it looked great with the odor others have described, but it smelled more like tanning dye which is the sign of leather goods.  Then I started looking it over and handed to the wife as a gift exclaiming what a great bargain this was at $210 vs what I paid at 20.  As I examined further I noticed that the \\""patchwork\\"" leather looked very soft and smooth... too smooth thinking what a great job of piecing the small leather pieces together.  Then I looked at the workmanship, which is rough.  Here too I was thinking maybe the workers who assembled it did not do that good a job and maybe this is why it was marked down so much.  So, I put my surgeons loops on to examine more closely only to find that the patchwork was not patchwork at all, but someone oversewed the material to make it look like patchwork.  THere were no seams.  THen I looked at the bead trim to see what kind of leather it was, and as I looked closely through my 20x lenses I saw that it was not leather at all.  All the trim material is made of the same stuff.  Then I looked at one corner of the \\""Lambskin\\"" bag and notice some very minor cracks.  Upon further scrutiny, this too is a plastic covered man made material of some sort.  You have probably seen the kind of imitation cheap thin plastic coatings on some other kind of material that is pressed to look like some sorth of leather.  Over time the stuff begins to peel. They even changed up the pattern so as to look like different cuts of leather.  At first glance it looks great.  Needless to say I was very disappointed but not overly surprised, more angry at myself for assuming.  It is true that you get what you pay for.  Silly me I paid for plastic and I got plastic and shoddily assembled to boot.  I immediately packaged it up to return.  When re-boxing I discovered the made in China tag.  Do yourself a favor and stay far away from these products.  Shame on you Heartland of America for fooling us this way.  This is not \\""Genuine Lambskin Leather\\"" or any other kind of leather!

Details...,"I was hesitant, but having read mixed reviews and liking the functions listed (inflatable, crescent shape, and removable cover) and getting a good Lightning deal, I took a leap of faith and bought two, keeping in mind their use by my passengers for an upcoming 20+ hour drive.<br /><br />They arrived and were somewhat nice-looking and the fleece was soft enough. Based on others' reviews, I didn't want to wait until we were mid-trip to test them. I immediately blew both up (easy enough with the large valve) and then placed a light book on top, simulating noggin pressure. Within an hour, the grey one was completely flat. Within a day, the green one was, too. Not good. Especially when you consider that their use in travel will cause extra stress (folding, unfolding, inflating, deflating, effects of airplane cabin pressure, etc.). I used to have a few smaller (& less $$) permanently felt-covered ones (just tossed in an ordinary pillow-case, for cleanliness) that I used for frequent travel and even for sleeping at home for a period of time - I know how much use these have the potential to get and how much it...well...sucks, when they leak.<br /><br />In addition, I found the shape to be anatomically uncomfortable. The sides are too flat and wide (think: dolphin fins), and the seams are noticeable, underneath the fleece. The sides, even when inflated, give no support to a neck that is bent to the side. And, when your head is tilted back, the front cuts into your throat. Awful!<br /><br />This product has the potential to be very functional for travelers. Easy to use/clean valve, removable/washable cover, inflatable/folds flat & small, crescent shape. However, the implementation should be an embarrassment to the company. I vote for a redesign of the shape, making the sides taller and narrower and an inspection on why they are so prone to leaking, and of course, a change in manufacturing to reverse this. While they're at it, improve the softness of the removable cover, just to be the icing on the cake.<br /><br />I have other travel products by Eagle Creek and I find them to be smartly designed and generally well-made.

But Hooray for Samsonite Customer Service!,"I purchased the 21\\"" Lift Spinner suitcase a few months ago & have used it on several trips. There is a manufacturing design defect that causes the suitcase to fall forward whenever it is packed. Clearly, the wheelbase on the 21\\"" suitcase is too narrow to be functional.<br /><br />When purchasing the item, this defect was not apparent as the suitcase was empty. So I chose this suitcase instead of another comparably priced 21\\"" Samsonite (which my partner has and loves) that I initially planned on purchasing.<br /><br />I have tried packing the suitcase w/ all of the heavy items at the bottom to no avail. It still tips over. Regardless, requiring such action on my part indicates that the suitcase design was either not tested properly (as the Samsonite warranty promises) or was not manufactured according to the tested specifications. I believe that this defect poses some danger as it may fall and injure a person (especially if the metal handle is extended).<br /><br />Initially I was excited to have such a lightweight suitcase, but my excitement has transformed into utter frustration. Other reviews from Amazon indicate that I am not alone. I am requesting that Samsonite either replace the bag with one that does not fall or provide a refund.<br /><br />This is my first review on Amazon. Thank you Samsonite!<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />UPDATE: Shortly after writing this review, I contacted Samsonite and requested that they replace the bag because of the manufacturing defect. The customer service rep responded in less than 24 hours, confirmed the defect, and offered to replace the bag with the redesigned Lift when it becomes available (She couldn't say when this would happen). Since I am not keen to wait indeterminately to resolve this matter, I requested that they just replace my faulty bag with one that I knew would not fall over all the time. Samsonite obliged and I await the arrival of my new bag.<br /><br />\\""Thank you Samsonite!\\""<br /><br />P.S. I'm keeping the one-star rating however, as the 21\\"" Lift still sucks.P.S.

One of the wheels exploded on my previous generic roll aboard.  I decided that I traveled enough to invest in something that would be durable.  It's really awful when your luggage fails you.  It leads to some painful treks through airports.  I decided on and have owned the Travelpro Crew 8 for about 9 months.  I was initially impressed with the bag.  The wheels were smooth rolling.  The handle retracted and extended easily.  It had an insert that proved to be somewhat useless for me.  I end up rolling up workout shorts in the fold of my dress pants to avoid wrinkles, so the insert only took up extra space.  It stayed in my closet.  The bag fit well into all the overhead bins of all the different planes I've been on. I thought it was a good, solid, functional bag.  On a recent trip, one of the pins in the handle retract and extend locks failed.  One side works fine.  However, it takes both to actually raise and lower the handle.  I was able to lower the handle by pressing in the pin by hand, but it took some acrobatics reaching inside my packed suitcase to get it to raise.  I finally gave up and just carried the bag with the handle retracted.  The bag did not get anywhere near the useful life I expected.  Actually, my travel decreased significantly over the final 4 months of last year.  This bag hasn't seen that much mileage.  I will try to contact the company for warranty service, but we all know how that goes.  You pay for shipping.  And, you don't have a bag for several weeks.

Waste of a lot of $$$ on these pieces,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00570HZR4 - Traverse Pro 22 (individual product link)  The Traverse Pro 22 (and its bigger companion, linked below) literally FELL flat of my expectations & was a HUGE waste of money. I say 'literally' because the luggage TOPPLED OVER -- ALL THE TIME and WOULD NOT STAND UPRIGHT ON ITS OWN. The black, plastic bracing piece at the bottom is 100% insufficient (not tall enough) to effectively brace the luggage upright. It was SO maddening to be unable simply to stand one's bags in place - they'd fall flat onto their front side EVERY time! If Eagle Creek wants to create dual-compartment luggage with both a back portion & a zip-off front portion, THEY NEED TO MAKE IT ABLE TO STAND UP!! Use a larger brace at the bottom, for goodness' sake. (Also: the detachable front backpack can start to detach/unzip on its own, and more importantly, is difficult to reattach to the main compartment, once both are packed. Problematic when traveling.) I bought both the Take 2 ORV Trunk 30 AND the Traverse Pro 22 carry-on bag. Both are listed to be very roomy and of course they look great in an athletic-yet-organized way. But my hopes for functional, long-term luggage have been dashed with this purchase. Who wants to be standing in line at the airport or waiting to check out of your accommodations, with your luggage constantly falling over? I got stuck on a 10-day trip with these awful millstones...it's not luggage, it's a liability!! One trip through airport baggage check and the Take 2 ORV Trunk 30 looked rather scuffed, too.

The \\""Crew8\\"" series is the current version marketed to consumers and the \\""FlightCrew4\\"" is the current version that is marketed to pilots and crew.<br /><br />I bought this bag before I came to this realization, and have been disappointed ever since.  I hate the design of this bag.  While it is light, it is much too flimsy to any kind of heavy duty use.  Travelpro included a relatively cheap, but pretty design on the attachment strap and the short handle, both of which are sure to break with significant use.  They've also rotated the axis of the long handle so as to make it harder to slide an extra bag over them.  The front pockets are designed for appearance instead of utility, and so the zippers have a funny looking \\""U\\"" shape and the pockets actually overlap, while being too thin to really hold anything.  The nylon is a thin weave designed to have a nice \\""shine\\"" instead of being resistant to damage.<br /><br />I later purchased a Travelpro FlightCrew4 22\\"" bag from an online store that caters to pilots and flight crew.  What a bag!  Nice sturdy ABS frame, real inline skating wheels, heavy duty handles with the axis in the correct direction, well-laid out pockets, and heavy duty nylon -- and $40 cheaper!  The only problem is that it is a bit larger than Travelpro claims.  So, now I use the 20\\"" instead.<br /><br />I also own a Kirkland 22\\"" suiter (available only at Costco), which is better than this one and only $99.00.<br /><br />So, do yourself a favor:  Skip anything in the Crew8 series (or any of Travelpro's consumer lines) and buy the FlightCrew4 from an online retailer or get the 22\\"" Kirkland at Costco.",15358.0

Unfortunately, the web strap on this unit pulled into a rope after a few uses, and I never was able to correct it.  Low-heat ironing would flatten out the strap, but soon it was back into an uncomfortable rope.  That in itself was a show-stopper.  The hook-and-loop fastening for the cellular phone pocket mysteriously failed to hold after a while.  Visual examination never revealed the reason; it certainly wasn't crudded up with anything obvious.  My phone never bounced out on the bike, but it was a concern.  The stitching on the main pocket recently gave way on the bottom, making that pocket useless for anything but stuff like bulky folded-up cycling kneewarmers that wouldn't fall out the bottom  I've never had a failure mode like that before.

I also would walk around with my 17 inch Laptop in the back and found the waist straps were cumbersome and useless. Its try difficult to adjust it when you have it on. Im 5'10 and it would sag down on my lower back causing discomfort on my back and on my shoulders. Also disappointing (not that I would buy it again) is that they only make one color. Black although they used to make a grey one but Oakley is very limited on their colors. The design is good for the bag but over long periods of wearing it then it becomes uncomfortable. A lot of pockets but Oakley needs to get better comfort and lighter colors. Its good if your going from your car to class but NOT for extended periods of use. Like over 30 minutes. AVOID AVOID AVOID!

Blocks light during daytime naps, traveling in a car or plane, or to help you sleep through the sun coming up in the morning. It fits around your face perfectly & keeps out all light since it has flappers that go further below your eyes on your face to keep out the light that can come in around your nose.

Several problems were immediately apparent, others developed later.<br /><br />First, the main compartment is certainly nice and roomy,and the zipper top is stiff in order to stay open like a box.  However, the sides are too flimsy and the bottom has no hard plastic insert to keep it stiff, so the bag just collapses when it is open.  This is even loaded with supplies.  In order to keep it stiff enough to stay open AND support the bottom, I had to put a hard plastic storage box in the bottom.  And yes, it is very roomy.  Too roomy.  It has tabs to hang things on as well as a back file folder pocket, and you can put a big roll of paper towels, disinfecting wipes and a box of gloves, but anything smaller ends up in a jumble of wound/ostomy supplies, trach care, O2 tubing and catheters.  The pictures make it seem like it stands open all by itself, but it just collapses.  This has to remain a totally clean area, you have to get everything out that you might possibly need before you start.<br /><br />The large zip-down flap has its own issues.  The big pockets WILL hold a stethoscope or a manual BP cuff, but it was such a tight fit for my wrist electronic BP cuff that I couldn't use the hard case with it.  But if I didn't use the hard case, it was still so tight it kept pushing the on button.  I'd be driving along and hear my bp cuff going off.  Add pulse ox, thermometers, measuring tapes, flashlight and it is a pretty tight fit.  There isn't enough room in this compartment for wipes or even hand sanitizer, so you can't use the front pocket for a file holder because this is now always a \\""dirty\\"" area, ended up wiping it down in my car.<br /><br />The side compartments close with a single velcro tab.  This means whatever you put in there better be big enough to not slip out if the bag tips or you bend over while it is on your shoulder.  Even large items like bottles of handsanitizer (not the small ones) will fall out.<br /><br />The other front zip compartments were fine, except if you had the bag \\""loaded\\"" you couldn't access the lowest zip pocket, which was where you were supposed to put your keys, cash, pens, etc.  Also there wasn't a way to organize small things like scissors, hemostats, etc.<br /><br />The back has a zipper file compartment that will hold three file folders, four if they are thin.  Not really big enough for anything but blank documents, but you have to pull out each folder to access what is inside.  If you are going to a facility and have more than three patients, you need another bag for their files.<br /><br />The bag itself started to fall apart after about 6 weeks.  First the shoulder pad frayed and eventually tore off as the slider slits weren't reinforced.  The big zipper broke and wouldn't close completely, the inside pockets and seams all started to fray and catch on the zippers, and then the bottom got a hole in it.  If I hadn't had the plastic box in it, things would have just started to fall out.<br /><br />I really don't have anything good to say about this bag except the pink is pretty. And I kept trying to make it work as long as I could, until I noticed the hole in the bottom.",15341.0

PROBLEMS:  1) Zippers are poor quality and open by themselves.  2) The straps are made of a very cheap vinyl that doesn't even look like leather.  3) The top straps are held on the backpack by magnets and can be lost very easily.  The stitching on the back pack seems strong, but the threads that make the canvas material can be pulled off and thus render the stitching vulnerable and compromise the overall backpack strength. It is extremely easy to lose the make believe leather straps that are being held on the back pack by magnets--extremely easy.   MORE OBSERVATIONS:  a)  The back pack when not inspected closely looks ok, but it is certainly not a backpack that you can use on a daily basis. This is more of a backpack intended  for a once in a while fashionable display.  b)  The backpack is lined and only has one main compartment so IT DOES NOT lend itself for use with a computer.  c)  The shoulder straps are adjustable, but not very rugged.  CONCLUSION:  AVOID this product if you are looking for a durable backpack that is strong and well made. This backpack would not stand up to daily use for long. I would give it less than a week before a cautious user lost the straps being held by magnets on the backpack. The zippers are very poor quality and won't last long. If you are a fashionable person that wants to look rugged without caring for the quality of the product you use, then this backpack may be for you provided your use of it is extremely limited.  I noticed that many of the people giving this product excellent reviews are first time reviewers and thus lack credibility.",15325.0

Waste of a lot of $$$,"This product literally FELL flat of my expectations & was a TOTAL waste of money. I say 'literally' because the luggage TOPPLED OVER -- ALL THE TIME and WOULD NOT STAND UPRIGHT ON ITS OWN.

It was SO maddening to be unable simply to stand one's bags in place  -- they'd fall flat onto their front side EVERY time! If Eagle Creek wants to create dual-compartment luggage with both a back portion & a zip-off front portion, THEY NEED TO MAKE IT ABLE TO STAND UP!!  Use a larger brace at the bottom, for pete's sake.

Now with World Wallet, you have to zip open just to reach for bills, which are in the same compartment with other valuables. This defeats the purpose of zipped compartment to me.

My current messenger bag has lasted for over ten years of travel and hard use, and is still going strong. This one only lasted ten minutes (including unpacking time).  I transferred over some (not even all) of the contents from my current bag and went to pick this one up by the strap, when I heard metallic pinging sounds. The strap immediately came loose from the bag, and the bag fell to the floor. Upon closer inspection, the rivets  that bind the handle to the bag had come apart and sprung loose. I was only able to find one of the two posts on the floor, even after extensive searching. I snapped that rivet back together in the hole, and picked the bag up again. After just a little carrying, the rivet sprang loose again and the handle came off once more.  I would not say I overloaded the bag, especially considering I was only carrying a small computer and a few accessories, and even left several items out.

However, it disappointed the few I had.  First of all, when the product arrived, it looked even cheaper than it actually was, and a lot less nice than the photos.

Secondly it doesn't really give you any bits to hold your luggage down, just several empty black holes to pile it all into.  The zips were also tricky, and when the luggage was full, tended to split unless the luggage was well below capacity. Even when the luggage is half-full, it doesn't stand upright on its own.

That is actually okay with me but if someone is looking for something that is indeed a true hard case, they might not like that. I also like the pink color which is not as vibrant as the picture but still a very nice color and actually closer to the pink blush color than the picture indicates.   My only concern currently is that the company would not take responsibility for only sending me one suitcase instead of the full set so I opted to send it back. So it has been 3 days now with me waiting on them to send me a return label so I can send it back and get my refund. I am guessing they simply goofed because I see the price is now up about $35 more than what I paid. They could have admitted the mistake but instead they blamed it on Amazon even though it is their ad and they shipped it (shoebuy).   So I just hope if you order it, you actually get your entire set  and if they finally decide to offer good customer service and send me a full set of luggage, I will update and raise my rating. But hey I order a set of 3 and get 1, I would have given no stars but that was not possible.",15251.0

It is more medium chocolate brown than burgandy but still has a little red in it. They should have called it medium chocolate. The only real gripe I have is the handle. Under the bottom of the handle where you curl your fingers is located a thin strip of plastic a forth inch thick and extending three eigths away from the handle and running he length of the handle, So when you carry the case this strip of plastic is pushing into your fingers and supporting the full weight of the case. If the case is loaded full and heavy then this thing is really uncomfortable and would actually hurt if you had to carry it for very long.

Luggage Set,"[[ASIN:B002TZY0XM Heys USA 4WD Metallics 3 Pc. Luggage Set]]  I returned two weeks ago from a trip to Chile.  Before I even got to the airport, one of the two wheels of the medium luggage (that is used for towing) broke as I went to the bus stop.  I had to rotate the bag 180 degrees to tow it using the other set of wheels.  Doing so made this luggage bump into the back of my leg unless I offset the way I held the handle.

The next place this set visits will be the garbage dump.  /////////////////////////////////  The shell is too flexible for my taste.  I expected a much harder and thicker one.  The zipper often got stuck when passing the midpoint of the bottom -- you'd  have to pull up on the suitcase (as if to open it) to make the zipper path taunt for smooth zipper operation.    The midsize survived one round trip flight to Greece, but on the next flight to Alaska, the side handle broke off at the metal clip on the return flight.  The telescoping handles are rather flimsy, and the wheels do not appear heavy duty.  Not a good buy for $330.  The only two things I ended up liking about the set was the color and the reinforced corners. Not good enough reasons to make it my long-term luggage set.

Clark TSA-Approved Triple Security Lockdown Lock With Two Steel Cables,Luggage,1,167,177,N,Y,"Alas, one failed me in the middle of a trip","I was rather disappointed, as I'm in the middle of a trip overseas and was hoping to be able to contact the vendor without writing a review, to see if the problem can be corrected.  Unfortunately, it does not appear that Amazon offers this service, so I am reduced to writing this review.<br /><br />I have been traveling for about 5 weeks and the three locks that I purchased were working perfectly until today, on a trip where I had just taken two of them along.  I was flying from Munich to Barcelona and was asked by security to open my carry on case, which was locked.  I was able to unlock it, and lock one of the loops, but the other loop would not lock.  When I arrived in Barcelona, got my luggage and went to the Tourist Office at the airport, I had to open my carry on as my hotel information was locked inside.  Though I had the correct combination, the lock would not open.  The Tourist Office then sent me to Customs, which directed me to another Terminal, where no one could help, and I finally returned to the original terminal and went to the Air Berlin Information Desk for help.  He informed me that if I had known the lock was defective BEFORE I came through the arrivals gate, one of the personnel there could have opened it; but once through the arrivals gate, you can not go back.  I explained my desperate need, as I had been running around for over an hour and did not even have the address of my guest house, as it was locked inside the case.  The man was good enough to offer to cut the lock - which he did, surprisingly with an ordinary pair of scissors.<br /><br />Now I am torn about using the remaining two locks, wondering if they will fail and again leave me running around strange airports for hours.  .  I left one lock behind in the Munich apartment where I am staying and am left with only one working lock - and the fear that the combination will fail again.  I will have to buy another lock on the market here.<br /><br />This is extremely disappointing and has colored my view of these locks - ordinary travel and after 5 weeks one suddenly doesn't work? I had read a review of someone who had this same experience, but not in the middle of a trip.<br /><br />I am both disappointed in the failure of the lock and then concerned that an ordinary pair of scissors can cut through the wire loop.<br /><br />I would appreciate hearing from the vendor about this.<br /><br />UPDATE:  16 days later and on a Sunday, I'm getting ready to fly again on Monday.  The second of the three locks has now failed.  It won't lock on one side, and following the lead of the first failed lock, it will completely fail.  So here I am on a Sunday and flying out in the morning and another failed locked.  67% failure rate and it looks like I'll have to replace all three before this trip is done.these locks - ordinary travel and after 5 weeks one suddenly doesn't work?

Then I went to the J World website.  They have a 12 month warranty, but you have to pay for shipping on your end (about $10), and send J World check for $14.95 for the shipping on there end.  So that would cost me about $25 to return this.  Also, they said it has to be a manufacturer's defect, not any kind of abuse.  So there was a risk that I send it in and they say my daughter abused it and broke the wheel off.  Also, you need the warranty card, and my backpack didn't have a warranty card, I only had the receipt.  So basically I have to eat this one.  Not happy at all with this purchase.  Also, my daughter has a light amount of weight in the bag, wheels it on a smooth and even sidewalk, and everything is one one level (no stairs).  I know she doesn't abuse it, because I take her to school and pick her up, and walk her in and out.  It is definately not abused or banged around, just poor quality.  When you look at how the wheel is attached, it is attached with a small 1/2 inch piece of cheap plastic.",15208.0

Travelpro has gone down in quality over last few years--this is my second difficulty in the last 4.5 years--and I promptly returned this model.  You're better off spending $40-60 less to get a similar quality bag.  These bags are now made in China, and the lack of quality and workmanship shows--the handle itself does not retract as easily as it should, and the bag feels \\""cheaper\\"" in construction than bags I have bought for much, much less.    The bag's external material (I had black) also easily blemishes on contact with surfaces, which was a further disappointment.    The suiter part of the bag is well-thought out.  The front pockets become fairly worthless if you have the bag fully packed in the main compartment and are trying to use it as a carry-on and stow it in the overhead.    Also, this DOES NOT fit lengthwise into a Boeing or Embraer jet, except for the Boeing 737-800.  I also suspect you may be challenged on an Airbus 319 or 320.

I would have thought that it was more durable    3) I was rolling the largest one in the train station and the pull up handle breaks off completely in my hand.    4) Both of the larger pieces have cracks around the wheels from the strain of the weight of the contents I guess.

She recently decided she wanted her own, the current version being the Crew 8.  We should have done more research.  The Crew 8 really does not seem worthy of the Travelpro name.  I agree with an earlier reviewer who says it seems like a generic Chinese-made carry-on (it's made in China) with the Travelpro name slapped on it.  We were suspicious it was a fake when we opened and inspected it, but more on-line research confirmed it's the real thing.  It is smaller (about 3/4\\"" narrower) and much flimsier than the Crew 5.  There is much less exterior protection from scuffing and wheel damage.  The handle is not nearly as strong.  The bag has two fewer large storage areas, no toiletry kit, no separate compartment for the suiter, and a suiter bag that is only about half length and includes no pockets (the Crew 5's is full-length, with a complete enclosure, two bars to help folding, and two storage pockets).  This bag is very expensive for the features and quality and does not appear likely to hold up very well.

After reading some positive reviews, I decided to purchase the Samsonite Travel Garment Steamer to replace an old \\""generic\\"" one I bought on eBay 5 years ago.    To give some perspective, I'll describe the one I previously had.   I purchased a garment travel steamer off eBay for less than $20 5 years ago.   When plugged in, this steamer provided a continuous stream of steam that would blast the garment with hot moisture and work out wrinkles in 2 to 3 swipes.   I used to use it on my suits and wool pants or even cotton shirts when I was too lazy to iron.  This was especially quick and helpful on business trips where I didn't want iron or was in a rush to work out wrinkles. After years of use, the internal water container in the steamer did finally give out and the internals of the steamer began to rust.    I received the Samonsite Steamer expecting similar results.   This item was more than double what I paid for the generic steamer that I previously owned.   After numerous attempts of using the device filling the device with water and allowing it to heat, I soon discovered that the steam was at best a trickle and did not work well at removing wrinkles.   I could even hold it up to my hand for quite some time before feeling a substantial amount of heat.   Needless to say, my attempts to try and remove wrinkles from a few suits or wool slacks were failures.   I'm somewhat disappointed that Samsonite would put their brand on a device that barely operates as it's intended.   Maybe I received a defected one, but I don't plan to press my luck and purchase another one.    I plan to return this steamer and continue searching for a suitable replacement.

First the positives: The suitcase looks great, and I was excited when it arrived. It moves easily and it is light. sDue to static it seems to attract a lot of dust, though. One has to wipe it off after packing it on a carpet. The interior is fairly small but that is a good thing when traveling. It forces you to be more conscious about what to pack.  To the negatives: After three flights the looks faded significantly. The edges are not reinforced, and there is a huge dent on one of the edges. Scratches are very visible and the surface is chipped.   It is amazing that a company with such a long experience as Samsonite would put out such a product.

I was looking to replace a similar Tumi bag that has problems with the attachment of the shoulder strap - the attachment keeps ripping off of the bag.    I would not recommend this bag: sub-standard construction and poorly-organized interior compartments. It looks like it should cost no more than $100.    - It does not have a very well-padded inner computer compartment and is too big - very wide and very long. I can fit two 14\\"" diagonal x 1\\"" thick machines inside with room to spare. Is this bag for a huge 17\\"" diagonal by 3\\"" thick machine?  - The interior pockets are more \\""exciting\\"" than functional: no pockets on the outside of the inner computer compartment, only one big zippered pocket on the inside. The various pockets on the front of the bag are fewer in number and smaller than what one would find in many other bags - overall, the bag has fewer interior storage compartments than the Tumi or many other similar bags.  - On the front of the bag is a compartment that does not zip completely closed - it has 2 zippers with a gap so one can reach in to access the pen holder (3 pens) and a small zippered pocket. That seems a bit too cute - anything loose in that section could easily fall out.  - The flap itself has a pocket on the outside with a vertical zipper - I find those a bit tricky as things tend to fall out unexpectedly.  - The shoulder straps are sewn directly into the bag, but the seams / sewing does not seem reinforced at all and looks like it could rip out (especially if the bag has a heavy 17\\"" diagonal x 3\\"" thick laptop!).    When my Tumi's shoulder strap ripped off for the third time, I found a messenger bag by be-ez that costs half the price but looks very similar to the B&R bag. The bag has numerous compartments inside near the computer sleeve for storing CDs, an external drive, etc. and an inside pocket that has inside several additional pockets (to organize those important things one wants deeper and more protected).

Well, the one reviewer who complained the belt absorbing body sweat, and the plastic insert that seems to serve no purpose and can easily fall out, was right on target.  I used this money belt during my trip last year to Italy during the summer, and after one day I had to ditch it.  Granted, it was very hot in Rome and I was sweating quite a bit, but this money belt soaked up my sweat, and the Euros inside were likewise soaked.  I had to lay my money out that night in our hotel room and let it air dry.  Yikes.  I kept my money in my wallet in a buttoned pocket of my cargo shorts for the remainder of the trip and did just fine (always being conscious of possible pick pockets).  I returned the item to Amazon, and they handled the return just fine.  If I were you, I'd look for a real money belt, or at least find something that you can strap to your waist underneath your shirt that does not soak up sweat like a sponge.

I've found that hardside luggage is preferred for international travel and this piece is reasonably light weight and holds a ton.  Its construction does not inspire confidence however, especially for a Hartmann piece, but it does the job if you are on an extended trip. One negative (or positive if you like the look of well traveled luggage) is that it gets really beat up looking after just a single trip, yet has remained intact (for the most part) after about a dozen grueling multi-country jaunts. Also, if you are looking for organization look elsewhere. This is this is just a shell. There is no organization inside to speak of.   One vexing issue with this bag is that the handle attachment fittings are made of cheap poorly fabricated aluminum. Both handles have broken after a only a few months use due to metal fatigue. The first time a hotel in Taipei kindly had the top handle repaired and both fittings replaced with what appear to be sturdier versions with similar fit and appearance. On my last trip the side handle suffered the same fate. I intend to call Hartmann tomorrow to get replacement parts which I will install rather than going through the trouble of sending the entire bag back. I'll let you know if I am unsuccessful or if the new parts break again.  I would likely not buy this bag again, but here are things to like about it - especially the spinner wheels.  Hopefully Hartmann will send revised fittings and the stress marks on the shell will not turn into holes or fractures.  I expect this piece will last two years at the most - disappointing for a Hartmann.  **UPDATE**  The replacement hardware arrived and was easily installed but shortly afterwards the luggage developed a large crack in its side at the beginning of an extended trip throughout Asia. Duct tape has been holding it together, but a few legs into the trip a side developed a new crack.  The luggage scuffs easily and looked terrible almost as soon asit was put in use.  It is headed for the garbage when I get back to the states. The warranty is worthless and it hasn't lasted a year. I own several Hartmann pieces. They once made quality bags and they stood behind them.  This is by far the worst piece of luggage I've even purchased and I fear it reflects a shift from quality to profit at any cost for Hartmann.

The repair company was unable to get replacement parts from TravelPro, so it's totaled.  I got 14 years off my Crew Plus bag, and barely 2 off this Crew 8.  I'm very disappointed in TravelPro and don't anticipate any future purchases of their products. Lowered rating to one star.<br /><br />Original review follows:<br /><br />I bought this to replace a broken, 14-year old Crew Plus bag from Travelpro.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed in the purchase and am considering a return. My key complaints:<br /><br />1.  The build quality is noticeably cheaper.  For example, where once was a substantial stitched leather handle, is now a cheap-looking plastic and thin metal handle.<br /><br />2. The former Crew Plus handle pulled out and retracted with no button - just friction to hold it. This button-equipped handle invariably collapses when the button is inadvertently pressed, regardless of how light the pressure. Very irritating.<br /><br />3.  The light gray liner is cheap looking and the cheap, plastic zipper holding it together separates at the lightest possible pressure.  The only fix is to unzip the entire liner to get the zipper teeth re-aligned and then re-zip. It's happened twice already in a very short period of time. By contrast, black nylon zippered liner in my prior Travelpro bag never separated in 14 years of heavy use from coast to coast and to Europe.<br /><br />4.  Travelpro eliminated the back pocket, which is where my second bag strap was stored. Moreover, the strap for the second bag no longer folds flat but is instead a rigid hook. It can't fit flat in a small pocket anymore, as it would protrude. The open-jawed hook also makes my briefcase prone to slipping out; something that never happened to the \\""seatbelt\\"" style clip on my previous bag.<br /><br />5.  For some reason, Travelpro forgot that this is a rolling piece of luggage and unwisely cluttered the front pocket upwith needless pouches, pen holders, and what appears to be a padded sleeve for a laptop computer.  Pointless.  My guess is >99% of users carry their own briefcase/computer bag. Why Travelpro would think I would like to clutter my luggage with briefcase-like paraphernalia is beyond me.  Make it an excellent bag for clothes and toiletries, Travelpro, not a half-baked bag for \\""everything.\\""<br /><br />6.  The overall appearance of the bag once I have it is cheap and tacky.  The older Travelpro Plus bag was classy and subdued.  Black on black.  This bag is cheap looking with cheap metal accents, zipper pulls, and wheel appliques.  It frankly looks terrible -- it's appearance is more inline with a cheap bag one might buy at K-Mart or JC Penneys than a supposedly higher-quality business bag.<br /><br />What a disappointment.

The rest being..ability to get to the airport, by train or bus.  This (31\\"") is not designed to be manouvered in any way other than its upright pulling position, it does not fit down the aisles of buses, cannot be manouvered easily through restricting barrier entrances to trains/airports, it´s back breaking and not condusive to manual handling due to twisting and lifting at the same time.  There is only one handle to do any lifting of the luggage, putting all weight on one side of the body.    So, Samsonite, it could do with another handle on the side for lifting, and the ability to swivel so it can fit through slimmer spaces than its full width, the rest of the case is just as I would expect of Samsonite´s high standards, hard wearing, durable, light as can be and no frills.",15110.0

Pre-baby, I loved it.  Great pattern, seemed sturdy, loved that it came with a padded changer and a wipes case.  I also loved that the material is easily cleaned with a wipe.<br /><br />Now here it is 8 weeks since my baby was born.  And I hate this bag.  It has so many flaws.<br />I see many people love these bags so I'm not sure why I'm in the minority... but here's my experience.<br /><br />Velcros: This is a huge issue for me.  You know how velcro has 2 sides, the soft and the rough side?  It's the rough side that \\""catches\\"".  This bag has the rough side on the bag instead of the flap.  This is a pain because if you don't have it completely affixed (say your bag is overflowing or you didn't match up the flap correctly because you're in a hurry), the rough side catches onto your clothes ruining them:(  My girlfriend who also has this bag says she's ruined her share of clothes.  Also, the velcro is an issue on the changing pad.  The changing pad connects to the outer zip-up area but the soft side this time is on the bag and the rough side is on the removable part. This is a flaw because the removable part is machine-washable but since there's no way to cover the velcro, other garments in the wash ultimately catch on this.  So I end up having to wash this by itself. Total waste.<br /><br />Outer pockets: There are two small outer pockets. They're thin but deep.  This is totally impractical.  It's really only good for a bottle or your wallet.  But to fit your personal things including wallet, phone, sunglasses and keys -- these side pockets will not hold it all.  Instead you have to use the inside of the bag which is a big cavern.<br /><br />Opening -- the top zippered part is designed in a way where you can't open the bag completely to see the inside.  Instead, the sides are pinched so you get a peek at the massively large space inside.<br /><br />Weight -- because of the glazed material, this bag is heavy.  Mine weighs 3lbs without anything inside!!  I weighed it on my infant scale.<br /><br />Key clip -- I was so frustrated thinking it didn't have one.  Well, when I dumped everything out, I found there is a key clip but the length is so short that it's useless.  It's also placed in a weird place in the big part of the bag.  I would have liked it if the key clip was somewhere easily accessible (ideally with one hand).<br /><br />Feet -- this bag doesn't have any.  That means if you have to put it down in a restaurant, bathroom etc, -- the entire bottom of the bag touches the floor...e[...]<br /><br />Handle -- There isn't one.  It would have been nice to have a small handle so it's easy to carry with one hand, to grab out of the car and to hang on the bathroom door.  I know there are many straps but when actually using it, it's awkward to try to use the straps quickly.  I end up having to shorted the top strap which is a pain.  I also sometimes leave that strap at home just to lighten the load a bit.  It's cumbersome to deal with so many straps when you're trying to access the inside of the bag, one-handed, while walking.  Only in a perfect world do you have counter/table space where you can properly open, close and access all that's inside the bag.<br /><br />The space inside does seem quite big but because the opening is limited, I feel like this is a drawback instead of a plus.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this bag but in the end, I ended up having to spend another $200 on a 2nd diaper bag which I'm much happier with.ght -- because of the glazed material, this bag is heavy.

I have many Victorinox travel products and the wallet I purchased was to replace an older Victorinox Zip Around Wallet I have had for several years (the zipper broke).  You could say that I am a fan of Victorinox products.<br /><br />Regarding my new Zippered Travel Wallet, I have to say I am *incredibly disappointed*.  I would like to point out some of the design flaws that have brought me to my current opinion, which follow:<br /><br />1.  The wallet is *too* large.  Once zippered, there is at least 1/2 to 3/4\\"" of empty space at the top of the wallet.  It is much larger than my older Victorinox zippered wallet.  Not only is It too large to carry comfortably in a back pocket, but also it is much too large to carry in a front pocket (where I choose to carry my wallet).  Frankly, it looks ridiculous to have it in any pocket is so large and uncomfortably rigid.<br /><br />2.  The wallet is too stiff.  The wallet is bulky and uncomfortable to have inside a pocket, and it is made bulky and uncomfortable because of the stiffness of the material.  It does not in the least way conform to a persons anatomy, and instead is like carrying around a paperback book inside my pocket.<br /><br />3.  The zipper does not completely unzip and therefore the wallet will not lay completely flat.  When you combine this with the stiffness of the wallet, it is impossible to quickly and easily take things from and place things into the wallet.  Imagine a hard-backed book that does not allow you to open it completely.",15082.0

4643,US,52252393,R2QOUTFQNYSSRH,B002EUWH46,499805478,Eagle Creek Travel Gear Hovercraft 22 Upright Luggage,Luggage,1,88,91,N,Y,Eagle Creek has made a knock off of their own bag.,"Back in April 2009 I bought 2 of the \\""Eagle Creek Hovercraft 22\\"" Carry On\\"" suitcases on Amazon, based on a friend's recommendation.  At $169 the price was pretty good.  Fantastic suitcase.  Really well made, strong materials, just a great product all around.  5 stars.  So when I needed another suitcase I knew what I wanted.  I searched Amazon for \\""Eagle Creek Hovercraft 22\\"" Carry On\\"" and the only bag that came up was this bag.  Looking at the photos and specs, it seemed like it was the same suitcase, albeit for $80 more.  Maybe a tiny change to the exterior color, but other than that, the same.  Worst case, I get a great suitcase that costs $80 more than it did 22 months ago.  So I ordered one and it just arrived.  WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK.  The quality went from 5 stars to 1.  The zippers are cheap, the fabric cheap, the wheels cheap (gone are the solid roller blade type of wheels and in their place are larger plastic like wheels).  Inside what used to be high quality mesh pockets have been replaced with a thicker cheap mesh, the kind you might find in a freebie gym bag or similar promotional giveaway item.  Or to put it another way, this is like the kind of off-brand or no-name (pretending to be a brand name) bag you find at a big retailer discount store (you know, the one that has lots of falling prices).  When you compare this bag to the other cheap luggage those stores sell, it looks pretty good.  But then after you use it a couple of times things start to break.  But put this bag next to the earlier 2 bags I bought in 2009 and it becomes painfully obvious how awful this new bag really is.  Side by side, the 2 year old bags look, feel, and function like THEY were the ones that cost a lot more (and not just $80 more, but hundreds more).  The older bags are just that much better, or to be more precise, this newer bag is just that much worse.  What Eagle Creek has done here, is take a great product, raised the price, and cheapened the materials and build.  It's like they made a knock off of their own bag.  I looked up my April 2009 order and the ASIN number was B001BLJONQ.  Do a search for it and you'll get a \\""Your search \\""B001BLJONQ\\"" did not match any products.\\""  Usually when a product has been discontinued you'll just get a page with the product, reviews, and everything else, along with a message telling you it is no longer available.  But not with the old version of this bag.  They really don't want you to know what they've done.  So the new bag is going back.  And I'm thinking I won't be buying any more Eagle Creek products, at least not unless I can inspect them first.  UPDATE: In the comments someone wondered if I might have received a counterfeit product.  I don't think I did.  In my opinion, the company is no longer interested in making quality products.  They just want to make as much money as they can, even if it tarnishes their brand.  As I wrote in my reply comment, that's what happens sometimes when good companies get bought out (which happened with Eagle Creek in 2007). Over the first couple of years, new owners usually have a lot of debt they have to pay down and the easiest way to do that is by cutting costs and raising prices. That's what they've done here.  On their web site they write: \\""The brand underwent major changes in 2010; Eagle Creek veteran Michael Millenacker became president and built on the legacy established by the founders. A new logo and brand image were chosen, and the brand's corporate headquarters was moved to Carlsbad, California.\\"" Yup.  Major changes.",15037.0

I carry very few cards, probably 8 or 9 on any given day, and very little cash, no more than 10-12 bills at any given time, and with these things alone the wallet is so overfull that it does not close correctly, and I'm worried that it's going to start tearing at any minute.  That doesn't count the 2 spare keys I've always kept in my wallet, or the days when my roommates give me cash for bills and rent to take to the bank.  The large slot that is designed for cash does not have a divider, which isn't a dealbreaker but it's annoying, and the clear slot in the middle that someone may put a photo or somesuch in is too small to even attempt to put something the size of a credit card in.  It seems more like a child's wallet more than anything.  If this wallet were designed with the end user in mind, it would be vastly improved, but since it is too small and tight to be comfortably useful, making a different choice would be the way to go.",14994.0

I can't imagine who would take this on a plane or lug it around in a suitcase--especially with the more recent airline fees and limitations on luggage.     I'm 6 ft tall and this isn't quite puffy enough to hold up my head and though the stuffing doesn't compress, it does move around a bit--so after a little while of use the marginal support  squishes around into inadequate support.  I'm sure though that for a smaller person for whom this fits, it would be very comfortable.    An inflatable pillow, while probably never up to the comfort potential of the buckwheat shells, can be inflated to accommodate your size and liking and is so light and small as to be trivial to tote around with you on travel. I keep mine folded away in my carry-on bag, ready whenever I go.    I could imagine using it in a car or for watching TV, if someone was so inclined to keep a football sized sack available at the ready.

I happened to be traveling AirTran the first time it happened and their fee was an extra $49 (each way), so this bag cost me $100 more than checking the 26 inch version.  If I had been on another airline, it could have cost me a lot more!    Also, I find that this bag is still partially empty when I've reached the 50lb weight limit, so the 26 inch is definitely the better choice.

My previous umbrella (different brand) lasted me for 7 years before it finally gave out. That's how I justify paying $35 for an umbrella as I figure I can buy 1 good one that will last a long time, rather than one of those cheap $5 ones that barely survive a year. Basically the higher price makes up for getting a new umbrella every year. And the auto open/close system is a really great feature (especially the close).    Anyway, I bought one of these umbrellas and it only lasted a few months. I actually spent another $5 to mail it in to get it replaced under warranty. I am currently using the replacement they sent to me, and already it's starting to break again (after just a few uses). There appears to be a design flaw in the way the spines attach to the top spoke of the umbrella, as those are what break easily (they snap off the top spoke). 2 of mine have already detached so that when I close the umbrella, sometimes it doesn't close properly and it looks like the umbrella has a broken wing as another reviewer pointed out.

The design is nice - pockets are good size and as other reviewers have noted the pack itself looks good. The leather is indeed high quality, and the seller delivered promptly.    Outside of the leather, however, the pack itself seems to have been assembled with the cheapest, lowest quality parts and labor available. Initial problems were with the belt size adjustment. Any weight or stress on the pack would result in the belt slipping. So the drink holder? Only good for holding an empty bottle. Any more weight and the belt will slip (cheap parts). I fixed this with Velcro.    Then the stitching that held the external pocket on began to come apart after a week (poor labor and parts). Still liking the pack design, I applied some super glue around the outside pocket. Problem solved. Or rather, on to the next problem.    I quickly found out that the slipping belt was actually part of the design of the pack. If it didn't slip the buckle would have to hold the belt together. However, the buckle is not up to this task (leading me to wonder if it really qualifies as a `buckle'). The male end of the buckle doesn't fit well with the female end, and never really 'locks' in place as designed to (cheap parts). This is not due to excessive weight, unless a cell phone, water bottle and wallet are considered excessive.    So now I've tossed the pack. If you are a do-it-yourselfer and like fixer-uppers, this is the pack for you. However, if you simply want a fanny pack that works, I urge you to continue looking. A pity - the design and appearance really are quite nice.    As an alternative, you may want to consider this pack:    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQ7NJ0/ref=oss_product    The external pocket of this one is not as roomy, but the design is similar, the belt does not slip and the buckle stays buckled.

It's amazingly comfortable, lots of space inside, lightweight, and nondescript.     HOWEVER - the whole package is ruined by the MOST AWFUL CHEAP ZIPPERS I've experienced on a backpack--- EVER! A day or two after I bought it, the top one split open quicker than those throw-away bags they wrap bedsheets in for sale. I was shocked - every other part of this bag seems designed for durability and theft resistance - but if the cheap zipper won't even hold then the thief can just reach their hand inside and not bother slashing the bag.     After repairing it and having functioned OK for a few days (the top flap is MISERABLE to close - should have been designed with a stiff material inside), the top zipper lost itself again today and I'm done with this bag, going back to my Eagle Creek one.

With all the hype that Pacsafe gives about their mesh material, cables through the straps, etc. - it's just ridiculous they don't seem to have given a thought to using a functional zipper.

However, this suitcase was unfortunately badly designed, and needs to be discontinued and redesigned.  Amazon needs to stop selling it, and the manufacturer needs to fix the critical flaw.    I have owned four Ricardo suitcases over the past decade, and they used to be extremely well made and durable.  I was recommending them to everyone.      But last month, due to the airlines' new carry-on rules, I purchased this suitcase, and the wheels failed on the first trip.  I thought maybe I just got a defective one, and replaced it for my next trip.  But the exact same thing happened.  No, I don't do anything unusual with my suitcases.    The critical design flaw is that somebody got the bright idea to make the front wheels, the ones you pull it along on, swivel.  Due to the small radius of the wheels, the poor bearing inside, and the swiveling axis of the pins the wheel hubs are mounted to, the wheels don't swivel, they wobble.  Then they literally start burning up from the friction this causes, and lock into the wobbled position.  You end up dragging your suitcase until finally you give up and lug this freakin' thing around by hand.

Finally after just 1 week the side started to rip. It got worse and worse and before the trip was even finished the bag was almost unusable. I think it has a poor design in that the strap on one end is held up by just a clip. I think that the weight of the purse pulled un-evenly on the one side causing the rip.

Right after we received the luggage one of the zippers came apart, I returned that to the store (they of course willingly paid for the return of the defective luggage).

We have only used one of the suitcases (the 28.5\\""). Once for a plane trip and once for a cruise which ended this morning. We wheeled it off the cruise ship ourselves so it has only encountered baggage handlers three times. On the first trip it came back with a long tear along the left back long side and a small tear in the fabric on the back panel. I repaired both these with duct tape and glue. After getting on board there was another long tear on the same edge further up, also the left front support block was so loose that I could have broken it off with one hand. One of the screws holding it on was partially out. When I got home all the support block screws were loose so I tightened them all. Part of the problem is that the metal frame is right under the thin fabric and it looks like if it rubbed against something unyielding it would tear, and that is exactly where the two side tears were. Another design flaw is that the extending pull handle is not recessed and also does not have a locking mechanism. It is easy to imagine it will be a casualty of baggage handlers in the future.      The luggage is very light and looks good. It is not made well enough for normal travel.       I also looked at the warranty. It carefully says the 10 year warranty is for defects in materials and manufacture. So it was made the way they intended and they are not responsible for those rough baggage handlers.

Over Christmas we checked in the largest suitcase into the airport in Madison, WI and when we picked it up from baggage claim in Denver, CO, the handle that you pull out in order to pull the suitcase on its wheels, was broken. Upon further inspection, we could see that the handle part had been dented inside the suitcase so it wouldn't pull out, and it had snapped off from its base. I called Samsonite and after being put on hold for a really long time, I found out it was still under warranty. They said that I would have to pay shipping in order to send it to the nearest repair shop, or take it in myself. The nearest repair shop is 75 miles away. We live in Madison, WI. I'm very disappointed. You should be able to check in a suitcase onto an airplane and except it to be sturdy enough to not break! And if it does, the warrantly should not be so complicated that it's not even worth having to pay yourself to send it it or drive 300 miles to drop it off and pick it up on a later date.    My husband took the medium sized suitcase (one size down from the large one) to Germany. When he was rolling the suitcase on the street to get to his hotel from the bus station, the wheels froze so they wouldn't roll anymore, and then they got scratched so they became flat.

By the way, I am a very \\""casual\\"" traveler and this piece had very little wear when it came undone.     Issue #2: For all of the review's about the product's design excellence, there is a no-brainer detail somebody completely forgot to address: the zipper zips vertically rather than horizontally. So, if the zipper is compromised while under your pants, bye-bye passport and money. This makes no sense at all.     Issue #3: The idea of a product that loops around your belt and hangs under your pants is great, until you have to go through Security at the airport where they make you take off your belt. Bye-bye passport and money. This product should be designed to hang on belt loops, not a belt.     Very disappointed with this product.",14503.0

If you send this bag only half full through an airline, it will get damaged.  It needs stuff in it.  The wheels are nicer than what it replaced (some off-brand) and the handle is holding up so far.  We'll see if it can handle the 120+ flights the old bag survived.  Only time will tell.  If you are an occasional traveler, this bag will work just great for you and last a long time.  My standards are higher because my needs are much higher.    I bought this bag from Luggage Pros and was not happy with them.

I'm also one of those unlucky people who had their luggage lost more than once (one time suitcase was not recovered at all, although airline did compensate).  So, for week long or so trips now I do carry on only.  This suitcase is absolutely ideal.  First and foremost, the size.  Most airlines will limit carry on dimensions to the total of 45\\"" (W+H+D).  This one fits the bill.  Older Delta airplanes for example have rather small overhead compartments, but this carry-on fits with no problems.  Secondly, it's very light weight, so with current weight restrictions it's definitely a help.  Last but not least, very convenient wheel setup.  Suitcase rotates 360 degrees and navigating it takes very little effort.  A big plus during the layovers or running through the airport.    I think that for carry-on piece (and I've had many), this one is as roomy as it gets.  Very comfortable space for 4-5 day trip for me.  I like the way Heys padded the telescopic handle, as those are usually a nuisance when it comes to taking up internal space.  So, they did nicely with the design.  As a rule of thumb, I usually make sure that everything I pack fits in (packing cubes are a huge help), and on the way back use the expansion feature for the things I end up buying on the trips.  It works out quite well.    The case also seems durable enough with sturdy zippers.  I got mine in silver: it's practical and stylish, and holds up very well on all my trips.

Later on they refused to help recover the sum that I had to pay despite the fact that luggage was under warranty.  Heys claims they have no control over shop policies, yet they still contract them for repairs? It was very disappointing.  Things break, that's why there's warranty, but I don't understand why it had to cost me to do the repair.  Hence the change from 5 to 1 star rating.

One week ago my husband started using it to carry his 12\\"" laptop to work. One week mind you. The metal clip on the strap broke, literally crumbling into pieces, and dumped his laptop onto the floor of the subway.<br /><br />I have never, ever had a metal strap clip break, even on the cheapest straps. And if the metal clip broke, I could just imagine how well those plastic clips holding the backpack straps would hold up.<br /><br />This bag is truly overpriced garbage. I'd give it minus 5 stars if I could.<br /><br />*******************************************************************************************************<br /><br />I bought it to use as a backpack purse, but it has too many shortcomings AFAIC.<br /><br />It's a perfect size, and I love the idea of the integrated steel mesh. However, there are some serious design flaws. The shoulder strap is adjustable, but only has 1 adjustment buckle. I found the shoulder pad to always be in the wrong spot when I adjusted the strap, and it is extremely difficult- nearly impossible- to get the shoulder pad over the buckle to reposition it. Most good shoulder straps have 2 buckles- one on either side- so you can adjust the length and have the pad where you need it. That was issue #1.<br /><br />There is a large main zippered compartment. Also there is a flap on the bag. Now, one would think that the flap- which is very big- would cover the main zippered compartment, where you presumably would have your laptop- but it it does not. It is sewn in front of the main compartment. In addition- the huge flap has NO zippered storage compartments at all. It also fastens with Velcro, unlike some of the better bags which use mechanical fasteners. It is pretty useless and always in the way.<br /><br />The split main compartment has one side for a laptop. You won't fit anything bigger than a 14\\"" laptop in there, and even that is a squeeze. For a netbook it's ok.<br /><br />There are NO zippered compartments in the main area of the bag. None- zero- zip-zilch. There are only 2 long nylon compartments, like the size used to hold eyeglasses- and these fasten with Velcro again. They are a PITA to open, as it feels like you will rip the thin nylon when you open them. If you put little stuff in there it falls out when you tilt the bag.<br /><br />There is a second smaller zippered compartment on the front of the bag, under the flap. Inside are 2 more tall nylon compartments, fastening with- you guessed it- Velcro. And again- little stuff falls out.<br /><br />Velcro has it's place, but it's cheap, and it's a real problem when you want to go digging in your bag to get something, say in a quiet theater? The loud \\""rrrriipppppp\\"" of Velcro will not be appreciated by those around you.<br /><br />Now we get to the backpack part...<br /><br />The bag looked great in the pictures. It has 2 removable backpack straps which fasten to 4 D rings on the back, and detach and stow out of sight when you're not using them.<br /><br />The backpack straps are the chintziest things I have ever seen. They have NO padding whatsoever. NONE. They are made of the same nylon the bag is, just doubled up and sewn up with a piping on the edges. As if that isn't bad enough- the clips on the straps and all 4 D rings on the back of the bag are plastic.<br /><br />The 2 D rings at the top, where the bag would be holding the most weight, are attached to strips of 1\\"" wide nylon webbing, which is sewn into a seam. When I put a netbook, camera, and my wallet in the bag- it looked like they would rip out in a very short time. I didn't trust it to hold the weight.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this bag. It looked great online. I love the idea of the steel mesh. But this is not an inexpensive bag. It usually retails for around $100. For $100- I do not expect cheap plastic hardware and Velcro fasteners. I also would expect a decent amount of storage compartments inside that fasten with zippers. For something that's also sold as a backpack, I would expect at least some kind of padding in the straps, and metal hardware.<br /><br />Personally- I don't think it's worth the money.nd of padding in the straps, and metal hardware.

The first day I really used this bag was during a 12-hour layover in London, where I walked around the city much of the day.<br /><br />I carried a Canon 40D with two relatively lightweight lenses, spare batteries, filters, and a small notebook. At the end of the day, while waiting at Heathrow for the next flight, I was shocked to notice that the bag was already beginning to fall apart! The outer fabric covering the shoulder straps had already begun to tear. So had the fabric above the zipper on the top pocket. The tear was large enough for someone to stick a hand into the pocket. I inspected the bag closely to see if something had caused these tears, but I concluded that the bag was just a piece of junk. It had begun to unravel itself under the weight of a bag that was not even half-filled!<br /><br />Not having any emergency repair items on hand, the unraveling continued to get worse over the next day. Finally, I had the bag stitched up in Kerala, India, thinking that would be it. Nope! Bye the next day, the bag had unraveled in other spots as well. I had it stitched up again in Mysore, and then again in Bangalore. Thankfully, these minor fixes cost very little in India. By the time I was almost done with Bangkok, I had bought a small roll of duct tape to keep my items from falling out of the bag.

It's amazing that they get away with charging almost $80 for this. Naneu Pro should be ashamed for manufacturing such an inferior product, while marketing itself to be an innovative company that produces high quality goods. I'm truly shocked that Amazon and B&H Photo carry this bag. A $10 bag from the local discount store would have been more durable. What a total ripoff!re durable. What a total ripoff!",14295.0

I suddenly realized I was dragging the luggage.  I tipped it over to see what was going on; the wheel was bent inside the wheel case, lodged hard to the side, and wouldn't turn anymore.  I managed to pull the wheel into the proper position and it could spin again, but the moment I put the luggage upright and started to roll, the wheel jammed once again and I was merely dragging the luggage.  I ended up putting my 'new' piece of luggage in tandem and wheeled it on top of my old luggage.  My old luggage supported the weight of both bags just fine, but I was thoroughly disgusted that the Wenger Swiss luggage that I fell in love with broke on its maiden voyage.<br /><br />I was sure the Wenger Company would be helpful because, after all, this was the first time I was using it.  They were very unhelpful.  I called them and they e-mailed to me a list of documentation that they would need, including receipt, warranty card, digital pictures, an essay about my problem with the luggage, and a couple of other things.  They told me that after receiving my documentation, they would evaluate my 'case' and see if they would fix the problem.  If they decide to fix the problem, it is then my responsibility to mail the luggage across the country to them at my expense, and then they will either repair or replace the luggage.  What a hassle.  I had to decide if I wanted to pay for shipping and insurance, that will be about 50% of the purchase price of the bag that I am now less than enchanted with.  I decided I'm just going to cut my losses and move on to another brand of luggage that will hopefully be sturdier and have a much better customer service.

I thought I might have a faulty umbrella until my wife said the same happened with hers.    The umbrella is also very hard to snap shut (necessary to do in order to reset the automatic release) unless you push it against the ground or something.  This is because the base needs to get very close to the handle, and the size and angle of the closed umbrella makes this hard to do.    I would avoid these.  I have now opted for a smaller umbrella that does not cover me as much BUT KEEPS ME DRIER AS IT DOES NOT LEAK.

We were in Arizona during a hot spell (105 and hotter).  The cooler could not keep up with the heat in the car.  It was not insulated well enough to hold the cool temperature we got while in our hotel room.  As an aside, we resorted to dry ice and a typical igloo type cooler.  It worked much better in this environment.  If the temperature outside is more than about 5 degrees hotter than the temperature you want the cooler to maintain, and you have to shut it off from time to time, don't buy this cooler.  If you want to cool it down at night in the hotel, and only use it while the car is running, then it might work.  We were very disappointed.  Finally, there is a compartment on the front of the cooler that held the cord.  The door to this compartment broke within the first 48 hours of ownership.  I simply can't recommend this product.  I know it's a pain sometimes to find, but use a regular cooler and buy 5-10 lbs of dry ice for $0.99/lb.  Separate the dry ice from the stuff you want to keep cold with paper - do not let any liquid you want to remain a liquid touch the dry ice directly.  The dry ice will last about two days depending on how much you open the cooler.  As long as the cooler is well insulated, the dry ice will hold up much better that this travel tote cooler did.
