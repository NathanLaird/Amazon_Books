I am so disappointed in the design and performance of this hot brush - oh, there is no air, so not sure why the title says &#34;Hot Air Brush&#34; - that's a misnomer.<br /><br />First disappointment - the plug.  It comes with an international plug, which would be good for using it overseas, but I'm in the USA....it does come with an adapter, so points for that - HOWEVER, it does not 'grip' the outlet enough to stay plugged in during use.  Any amount of movement of the cord will cause it to just drop out of the outlet - go ahead, try to use this without moving the cord (I couldn't).  Next, both prongs are the very same size (not the US standard), so you have no idea which way to plug it into the outlet to get proper polarity - unless, of course, you know how to interpret the &#34;L&#34; and &#34;N&#34; label on the back of the adapter.<br /><br />Next disappointment - the slider with the  &#34;LOCK and UNLOCK&#34; symbols.  I'm guessing it's supposed to lock the brush closed so you can use it mainly as a hot brush, and so it won't open to become a flat iron while you are using it as a hot brush (Why am I only guessing?  Because I can't read the enclosed instructions).  Anyway, you slide it closed, and all seems well - then, lift it up to your hair to roll your hair around the hot brush...but, wait - the slider has now slid back down on it's own to let the brush open, and you now have a flat iron ready to go.  But, wait, I want to use it as a hot brush....slide it over to LOCK again, lift it to my hair, and there it goes again opening on it's own.  Seriously???  The slider is so loose that it will move to UNLOCK on it's own with just angling the brush upwards toward your hair - or with even the slightest touch from your hand.  This can actually be dangerous, as you could unwittingly put your finger inside the open flat iron that your aren't expecting to be there.  So, someone please tell me how I'm supposed to use this without angling it up, or touching the handle with my hand?<br /><br />Next - and last disappointment (because I'm definitely returning it at this point) is the OFF / L / H slider button.  First, there is no indication what temperature L and H are, so it's a guessing game (hopefully L isn't too low to get the job done and H doesn't fry my hair).  I go to the instructions - which are completely in Japanese (?), I think, and it tells me that L is 160C and H is 200C.  OK,  stop / Google / remember 160C = 320F, and 200C = 392F.  No other temperature options to choose from.  Then, the fun part - if you manage to keep the brush closed so you can hot curl your hair (refer to paragraph above), or maybe you just want to use the flat iron - start by setting the temperature you want to L or H, then begin to apply, BUT WAIT - the temperature slider switch just moved....what?!?  Are you kidding me?  This slider is also very loose, and placed right where your hand placement is, and any slight pressure can cause it to slide, either to another temperature setting, or off altogether.  Multiple attempts to avoid this by holding the handle a different way were NOT successful.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being too detail oriented - but I don't see anywhere on the hot brush where it says SamJoy....also, nowhere in the literature that I can read - but, then again, as stated - it is NOT written in English.<br /><br />Does it have an Auto-Off feature?  I have no idea....because I can't read the instructions!  How can I find out?  I guess I could duct tape the plug so it wouldn't fall out of the outlet, set the temp to L or H, then lay it down carefully so movement doesn't turn it off, set up a timer, then watch to see what happens.... but, I've already spent 45 minutes trying to use it while constantly having to plug it back in / moving the slider back to LOCK so I can use it as a hot brush / giving up and deciding to flat iron my hair / wondering why it wasn't hot enough - because the temperature  slider turned it off while I was using it!  Argh!  Also, there's the 15 minutes collectively to unpack it, now  repackaging it so I can send it back.  That's a whole hour of my life I can't get back.

The good news is that I felt no negative side effects but the bad news is that if you buy this you are totally wasting your money! I must admit that I was doubtful of all these fantastic claims I was reading about on here but I decided I would give it a try and use the entire 30 day supply before I made any judgment call. I really hoped I could find some benefit from taking it, even if I did not see the growth and/or hardness that others claimed ( although many of these people readily admitted they had accepted a free months supply for their positive comments). I firmly believe these reviews should be honest to help others decide whether to buy or not so I tell it like it is. So my advice is to waste your money on something else because you get nothing from these tablets.",16599.0

Simple As That People!! Don't Waste Your Time!!,"I'm going to be honest and blunt with this review, plain and simple. I purchased this item for two reasons: first being an improved sexual life, and second being improved physical workouts. Well, I've seen absolutely ZERO affects on either one, and it seems I'm swallowing placebo pills to be honest.<br /><br />I also tried reaching out to the company who makes this supplements asking about one of the warnings, but since email is the only form of communication, it doesn't surprise me I haven't heard anything back. What kind of company only allows communication via email anyway? In my opinion, certainly not a company that is confident, right? Not a company that stands behind their product, right?<br /><br />Something seems off, that's the best way I can put it. I purchased 3 bottles of this crap, and being almost done with the 1st bottle, nothing improved whatsoever. My guess is I'll receive a reply back from this feedback stating I MUST give it 3 months to fully take affect, but lets get real, NOTHING should take 3 months to fully work in a human body. Heck, even anti-depressants only take 4-6 weeks and that's working strictly on brain chemicals. What other sexual enhancement products take 3 months to work? What about any type of performance/weight lifting/diet supplements? The answer is NONE!!<br /><br />I'll end this review with saying this companies marketing gimmick of &#34;WAIT 3 MONTHS&#34; is nothing but a money making scheme.....rather than having their customer buy 1 bottle before saying it sucks, you NEED to buy 3 bottles....what a joke!!!

I'm a pianist and I really struggle with reading the little black dots of music at times. My mother bought me some adjustable focus glasses that look like they should be worn by a clown- but at least they WORK. I have one near sighted eye, and one slightly far sighted eye, so had hoped these would be perfect.<br /><br />There is no problem with them adjusting.  But they're so cloudy to look through I can't actually SEE things well. My mom is quite nearsighted so I had her try them and she can't see with them, either, no matter how she gets them focused.<br /><br />I would try another pair of adjustable glasses in a heartbeat. But would love to see them make some with a slightly bigger size of frame around the eyes- these are quite small, so with the curve or &#34;indention&#34; around the edges of them, it makes you pretty sick to your stomach if you turn your head or change the direction of your gaze.

He's going to need this chair to help him get up when he needs to, a place where he can sleep, and be comfortable. I say \\""going to need\\"" because it's still NOT here yet!<br /><br />The chair was $525 and we decided to pay an extra $270 for in home delivery and set up.<br /><br />The order was placed on June 16th with delivery scheduled June 20th - June 25th.<br /><br />I tried tracking through Amazon but it said tracking was unavailable for this item.<br /><br />So we were stuck just expecting the chair between the delivery days. We spent 4 days moving our schedules around to make sure someone was here. On the 24th we decided to email the seller to find out when it would be delivered. We got an e mail back saying the 3rd party (AIT - Worldwide Logistics) which is a shipping company had tried calling twice but had the wrong number.<br /><br />If they called a customer and that number didn't work you would think the next step would be to e mail the customer? They didn't.<br /><br />It took us e mailing the BACKSTORE, them emailing us back with AIT's info, letting us know AIT tried to call us but had trouble, us calling AIT only to be told they now couldn't get to us until the 27th between 12 -4pm. The chair is at a facility that is only about 30 miles from our house and they're making us wait 2 more days. That is 11 days after we ordered it.<br /><br />Meanwhile we have all had to move our schedule around again to make sure someone will be here, my dad is still uncomfortable, and we have no chair yet.<br /><br />In the end after multiple phone calls all we got was AIT pointing the finger at the BACKSTORE, the BACKSTORE pointing the figure at AIT, AIT pointing the finger at US, for them not having the right phone number, even when they had our e mail and could have easily e mailed us, AIT and the BACKSTORE both pointing the finger at Amazon, and still no chair.<br /><br />Update: It's now June 27th and I just got a call from AIT - Worldwide Logistics the worst delivery company I have ever worked with.

It's very light, and does not have an on/off switch.  The ionizer in my &#34;SunTouchPlus&#34; light is much better... it really cleans the air nicely and it smells like it does just after it rains (but it only cleans air right next to the light, and quickly wore out)  so I was expecting a waaay more powerful affect with this &#34;high density&#34; ionizer.",16235.0

I bought this because it advertises to wirelessly sync to the app; however getting a wireless connection was impossible.  I am NOT technologically challenged and have never had an issue with electronic devices, but I could not get this to sync.  The directions and manual like all other iHealth products are lacking, however their other products that I own (wrist blood pressure monitor, blood pressure dock, activity tracker) I have been able to figure out despite the lack of instructions.  I sent an e-mail to customer support for help and they sent back instructions for everything I tried.  In the end, this ended up being returned.  I bought a Weight Gurus that measures more than just weight and body fat and while you have to scan a QR code on the scale to upload it to your phone app and the app doesn't play well with other apps for seamless uploading (i.e., MyFitnessPal), it sure beats a one hundred plus dollar scale that only measures weight.<br /><br />Here are the steps I tried and maybe this may help you:<br /><br />1.  Make sure your bluetooth is enabled on your phone.<br />2.  Press Set underneath the battery door on the bottom of the scale.<br />3.  Go to your phone and wait for the scale to show up as a device in your bluetooth list.<br />4.  Select Pair to pair the scale and your phone.<br />5.  A pop up window will appear for you to allow the scale to access wirelessly to your phone, click OK (or yes, can't remember exact term).<br />6.  Now go to the iHealth app.<br />7.  The WiFi icon should now be flashing on your scale.<br />8.  It's important to open the app and go to the scale feature in the app while the WiFi icon is still flashing.<br />9.  A screen with the scale will appear in the app saying to please wait while the scale is connecting to the wireless connection.<br />10.  And....HOLD FOREVER because it NEVER got past this screen for me.<br /><br />I never even came to the scale screen waiting to beconnected wirelessly until after multiple tries and seeing that I had to open the scale in the app WHILE the WiFi icon was still flashing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />iHealth App plays well with other apps (MyFitnessPal) and you can access your data in their cloud<br /><br />Cons:<br />App is useless for this scale because you can't get it to connect to wireless.<br />You're supposed to still be able to use this scale to read the other measurements even if the Wifi isn't connected, after the first Wifi connection, but since I could never get it to connect to Wifi, I could never view the other measurements.<br /><br />Even with the difficulties, I would be willing to spend some time on the phone with customer support even after I e-mailed them to try to figure out what the issue was with connecting to WiFi, but the scale is NOT RELIABLE.<br /><br />I weighed myself 10 times in a row and I only received the same measurement twice.

I heard someone say they used a clamp but I can't see a way I could do this on my dressing table. I guess I could try putting a stack of textbooks on top of the base or a heavy doorstop but that wouldn't be very attractive...Even if I did the rod would just droop I think with the weight of my dryer.<br /><br />Plus there were really no instructions except the description on the outside of the box...I found this extra silver plastic rod thingy inside the box so I stuffed it inside the rod thinking maybe that would help stabilize it (I assume that's why it was in there) and it did make the rod slightly less bendy I think but only slightly, and it didn't help with the balance issue as the base is simply not sturdy enough and it still tips over. Too bad guess I will keep searching or buy one of those crazy hood dryers.<br /><br />I did try putting my lightest weight travel dryer and it seemed to hold that one just fine.

First off, it does not stand easily on its own when you let go of it, as the descriptions and advertising would have you believe. It's a rather delicate balancing act that you have to perform, totally unrealistic to be expected of elderly/disabled persons. It gets worse when you add the batteries for the built-in flashlight; they mount inside the handle grip, which totally throws off what little balance this cane has. Having the batteries located in the down tube of the cane itself would help alleviate this design flaw, but can't say if it would be enough. The cane also will not adjust any lower than is appropriate for someone about 5'6\\"" tall, another considerable shortcoming. I found the TrustyCane to be unacceptable and do not recommend it. It is a defective design and does not work as advertised. When I returned the cane for refund, The Family Place proved to be less than family-friendly by making me pay for return shipping. This isn't a case of \\""I changed my mind\\"" or \\""didn't like the color\\"", this is a defective or misrepresented product and the distributor should pay for the return.

For me, full back, chest. The first 2 sessions all went great, then on 3rd one we observed that with same laser settings, the product head would start randomly cause skin burns, in completely random places. Mind you, it's winter time, we're absolutely out of suntan and been so since we started this back in January.<br /><br />The head protective glass would start to overheat and we could feel the heat in between the pulse discharges even when we moved the head from one spot to another on the skin, you'd feel the heat from the glass. We had to literally let that glass cool off for more than the 3.5 sec that the machine has built into (when it emits a beep to let you know). The machine has a lot of safety things implemented, one being 3.5 sec in between pulses, technically allowing it to cool off.<br /><br />On 4th session, after 15 minutes of use, the head started making some louder popping sounds. As per manufacturer's instructions, these should be considered &#34;normal&#34;. We really enjoyed that since we thought some hair follicles really got destroyed permanently (yay!).<br /><br />And then the disaster happened. On next pulse discharge the head unit exploded, an electrical fire started inside the head, the unit started smoking while continuing to make electric flames and explosion sounds. I had to literally rush on and pull the cord from the power outlet before everything would get out of control.<br /><br />My wife ended up with a huge skin burn from the disaster and nearly got electroshocked when the laser head exploded and started looking like a welding machine.<br /><br />I tried to contact the manufacturer's support line. Surprise (or not). Nobody picked up the phone, I was asked after a long wait to leave a phone number so they can call me back. None has so far. I emailed them using their website email address and also using amazon contact form. Nothing.<br /><br />Pretty sad, paid several hundreds for this unit and it's clearly unsafe to use.

It is not from cutting facial hair. The cutting edge of metal razor blades are subject to corrosion from the moisture left over after each shave. If you carefully dry the cutting edges of a multi-blade razor after each shave it will provide close, comfortable shaves for months. I'm on day 84 with a Gillette Mach 3 disposable razor. I dry the blades with a section of paper towel after each shave. Harry's 4 blade razor became rough after just one shave. In fact it nicked me twice and I've never been nicked while using the Gillette. I attribute the poor performance of Harry's razor to the tight fit between the 4 blades that prevent drying the top 3 blade edges.

You can make one of these yourself if you have any sewing skills.  The velcro wears out after awhile and then the thing is useless.  The shipping is $ 15... I seriously doubt it costs Julie Tupler that much money to mail something that weighs less as much as a feather and can be folded up inside of a box you could put earrings inside of.  This is just another way to get more money out of desperate customers who hate the way they look after having a baby.  If she really wants to help us out she shouldn't be charging so much for her products and taking advantage of us like that.<br /><br />I will say that this thing does work (somewhat) when you do the exercises with it, and mine was great for my back pain.  But I am sure that any back splint would do the same trick and cost a lot less.  I was able to lose about 3 inches off my waist.  Be forewarned though that you will not have a flat stomach again.  Sure, there is improvement.  The lump I had above my belly button got flatter so that was good.  But the lower part of my abs still stuck out, which is also the result of a diastasis.  I even got down to 114 pounds (I am 5'6) and my stomach still stuck out.  I had a smaller waist with a slightly protruding lower abdomen.  Look at the after pics of other women on the Diastasis Rehab web site and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Also, just as soon as I stopped doing the exercises and wearing the splint, my diastasis came back.  So you have to do this for life.  And the splint won't last more than six months top with daily use.<br /><br />The only cure for a messed up stomach after having a baby is surgery.",16086.0

Just so you know a little more about this specific situation, I'm going to be give some facts about me and my body<br /><br />-I deal with pain well<br />-my hair is super dark and thick<br />-my pores are ginormous<br />-I'm 17 years old so my skin is still fairly sensitive<br />-I'm a little bit larger, so I have cellulite in some of the places I was using the epilator<br /><br />I know, I sound gross, but I thought those were important details about my experience. Anyway, I first used the epilator a few days after shaving because that's what everyone says to do. The first time, my skin burned and I had large red and white bumps that looked like mosquito bites. That reaction lasted about an hour. Also, there was blood. But, I figured that was normal. I mean you are yanking out several hairs by the root at one time, so yeah it's going to hurt like a bitch and leave a mark. So, I did was everyone says to do. I exfoliated, I used Aloe Vera to soothe my skin, then I waited a few days, showered and tried the epilator again. IT HURT JUST AS MUCH AS THE FIRST TIME.<br /><br /> I was told it gets easier every time you do it.<br /><br />FALSE.<br /><br />My hairs were no softer than they were before and it HURT SO MUCH.<br /><br />Soooooo I thought, maybe I just didn't get all the hairs the first time.

I contacted Solingen/Merkur in Germany and their lifetime warranty isn't worth the paper upon which it is written!  They asked for photos, which I sent.  I didn't bother cleaning up the Razor.  They had the unmitigated gaul to tell me that the shaving soap had corroded the part and it was not covered.  REALLY???  A $150 dollar safety razor which dissolves in shaving soap?  SERIOUSLY???  I subsequently cleaned off the soap ant there was not so much as a hint of galling from chemicals!  No more business from me.

It is not a knock off from Amazon (most likely) but Hitachi wanted their name off this product a long time ago. It is written on an online blog and other sites that the \\""new improved 2013\\"" model has a 10 watt motor and they are blaming everyone and everything but the product for the problems this massager now has. The better older model massager had a 20 watt motor. I bought mine from a \\""reputable\\"" site and after using it for a few minutes black ooze was coming from the head or ball of the massager down the stem and it was extremely hot. The massager was under warranty and I received a new one, same model. This new one I received as a replacement becomes very hot very quickly. It also is not effective, it is irritating. I want my money back. The new and older models are obviously different than the new model and the new model is much worse and dangerous due to overheating so quickly, not the time frame recommended and people laugh about, I mean in two minutes to five minutes time this massager is overheating and could either burn a person or start a fire. There is a  blogger who was given a free \\""new improved 2013 authentic model\\"" of the massager and she stated she noticed no difference even though she knew beforehand that the wattage was less and then she went on to say the new one was as effective as the old model and with much emotion stated she horded some of the old ones before she tried the new model in case this new one she was given for free to review was not effective and was no longer the best massager/vibrator a person could buy. Notice the word FREE, it is not likely she will receive other products to review if she writes a negative review. A website that sells this massager widely promotes their website as being the only one who you can be sure has the authentic product and often writes negative comments about other websites you might buy the massager from, especially Amazon and Ebay. This person even gives an exact amount the product should cost. I do believe that is called price fixing. When I called the company I bought the first massager from, I was told of the change to the wattage and also told the new model weighed less due to it was electronic rather than having a motor. I know it is not as effective, it gets hot easily and could very easily hurt someone. In my opinion the company that now is making the massager formerly made by Hitachi is trying to cut costs and manipulate the public. In other words, nothing is wrong with you if you notice this massager is no longer as effective as it was or that it overheats in a  very short time. Please be vocal and don't be embarrassed to type the truth and let the company know if you bought one and it is not as it is advertised. This product is no longer the best massager a person could buy, it is a product that could burn you and it does not work anywhere near as well as the older model. I am not embarrassed to post the truth and I want people who read this to know, if you find this massager is worse than the prior model that there is nothing wrong with you, there IS something very wrong with this massager. I would rather post the truth than have someone get burned, literally or figuratively by spending money on a massager that should be taken off the market it is THAT dangerous. Both of the ones I have received have overheated within a very short time, we are aware the new model does not have a 20 watt motor as the old model did, we know it has a 10 watt something, whether that be a motor or an electronic panel. I have nothing to be embarrassed about but the company that is making this massager and then trying to make people believe that the problems are caused by massagers that are not authentic have everything to be embarrassed about, but instead of fixing the problem they blame every other company so I don't think they are embarrassed. I think as long as they can continue to fool the public they will be laughing all the way to the bank. The Emperor Has No Clothes. This massager does not work and is dangerous, the truth is always going to be the truth.",15957.0

This thing cures gout, gallstones, kidney stones, the common cold (no really, search Yahoo! or Google), and probably cancer and HIV (again, really, search about it)<br /><br />What you see in a lot of these scams is a small group of individuals that link trade, review each others products, and spend a lot of time posting on boards, creating multiple amazon accounts etc to boost their own product sales to good, honest people who just want to feel better (There is a special place for people who prey upon others like that).<br /><br />You can find actual studies (not the first 5 search results which all lead to fakes) that show that this might actually help with kidney stones, WHEN COMBINED WITH OTHER TREATMENTS.  I saw one &#34;review&#34; on another site that claimed &#34;Even surgery couldn't help me but I passed my kidney stone with this!&#34;  Short of the rock of Gibraltar, surgical options (many options out there) are 99.9997% effective when combined (that's 5 nines).  Not always desirable for sure, but effective.<br /><br />There is not a single study that has shown Chanca Piedra has any effect what-so-ever on existing stones.  Keep this in mind and read on.<br /><br />The study quoted on Wikipedia for example is accurately quoted, but cherry picked.  It fails to mention that success was achieved in combination with another therapy and not in getting rid of existing stones but through other effects such as better urination.<br /><br />Chanca Piedra most likely does have a an antispasmodic effect.  This can in turn make the pain of passing a stone less.  Can increase urination and other things where spasm effects are undesirable.  It may also cause calcium deficiency.<br /><br />My complaint isn't a much with chanca piedra (it probably has good effects in some people) as with the way it is marketed.<br /><br />Who is assuring you that you aren't getting snake oil?  How do you KNOW you are a getting chanca piedra with this product?<br /><br />Read the copy selling this.

If this is sold by a company other then Amazon make sure they will take the product back.<br /><br />Again the shave was good it was just that the mechanics were faulty.<br /><br />Thanks for staying tuned.<br /><br />------------------------<br /><br />Yes I took this Safety Razor out of the box set it up and started to shave my week old beard.

I found also that the weight of the Merkur was just right.<br /><br />I was amazed at how smooth the shave was, and how easy it was to just jump in and shave. I will leave more of a review later when I have had more time with the equipment.<br /><br />I did use the Merkur blades that it came with and it did a fantastic job other then one nick.<br /><br />Why did I choose to go to a Safety Razor for the first time in my life.<br /><br />1.

AWFUL!<br /><br />Not to mention it shows the utter IGNORANCE regarding vaginismus (experiencing pain makes the physiological disorder WORSE, not better, and the disorder has nothing to do with the size of your vagina, it's about anxiety and involuntary contractions of the vaginal muscles).<br /><br />If you want comfortable relief, you need to go to a sex shop and get yourself some fun little vibrators. You can get ones that are soft, pliable, in different shapes, sizes, textures, and then get yourself some lubes, try different kinds like warming or numbing. Go slow, relax and really take your time. Make sure you are letting yourself breathe. Then just practice going through the motion. You may need to do this consistently for a while (weeks or even a few months) to train your body/mind that penetration is NOT painful, in order to help your muscles be calm and relax and not contact really hard against your will. Just going through the motions with your little toy/vibrator (much more comfortable than the horrid plastic chunks in this kit) will help you loosen up little by little, too (rather than trying to just shove something in there that doesn't fit - good lord!).<br /><br />When you are ready you can buy a new toy/vibrator that is a little bigger and take it from there. If you are in a relationship, get comfortable with just you using the toy alone first, then have your partner try. This helps you get comfortable and relaxed over time with your partner, too.<br /><br />But seriously, that is all you need. A little toy/vibrator, and there are SO many to choose from, in stores and online as well. Better shapes, textures, softer and more pliable.<br /><br />Do NOT waste a bunch of money on these mean, uncomfortable, hard pieces of plastic!!!

I'm going to go out on a limb and say the device itself will still be useful and enjoyable for anyone who DOESN'T have an iPhone.<br />__________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />I've purchased several different types of pedometers in the past and they always wound up in a drawer after a couple weeks.  Just couldn't learn to love them.  I finally broke down and purchased a FitBit Zip several months ago and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Setup:  A snap.  You can easily go to the main website and download the web based version of their app, which is nice to get a bigger (or easier) view of your day's activity.  You just plug in the USB dongle into an open USB slot on your PC and it'll walk you through the rest.<br /><br />Battery:  I've heard a few people complain about the cover breaking, etc.  I can honestly say I've had no issue here.  Understand, this is a small device...if you use brute force trying to wrench the cover off, well then, I can see how you would break off one of the little clips.  Use standard human force and you'll be fine.  I've also found that if you push down (a *little* bit, human strength people!) when you're trying to open/close it, it works a little better.  If you're like me and tend to misplace the little tool to open the back cover, a trusty ol' penny works just fine as well.  I've had the same battery in this since I purchased it (about 3 months ago) and haven't needed to replace it yet.<br /><br />  ** Update 6/21/2013:  I purchased this in February and had to replace the battery today (June 21).  That basically equates to daily wear & tear (I even wear it to bed) of around 4 months of battery life.  Not too shabby, and I ordered several spare batteries here off Amazon to keep handy.<br /><br />Ease of use:  If you can tap with your finger, you can figure this out.  It will cycle through the time, steps taken, distance, and the FitBit happy face.  You set your daily goals either on the website, or on the mobile app and the closer you get to your goal the bigger FitBit's smile gets.  Little thing is addicting, I tell you. Once you reach certain milestones (5,000 steps, 10,000, etc.) you'll get an email saying you earned a \\""badge\\"" (think gold star when you were in school).  Such a menial little boost of encouragement but darned if I don't find myself striving to get the \\""next\\"" badge.  :)<br /><br />You can also invite your friends (who have a FitBit device) to be your \\""friend\\"", and you can watch each other's daily steps.  It helps keep me focused when I have a little bit of friendly competition.  \\""Hmmm I'm in the mood for ice cream.  &lt; checks FitBit and sees friend has 3,000 more steps than I do >...Scratch that...&&lt; gets on treadmill instead >\\"".<br /><br />What I found to be the most beneficial way to start:  Get this puppy up and running and just wear it like normal for a week to get your \\""average\\"" step count for a week. Ladies - this easily tucks inside the strap of your bra and no one will ever see it. You'll forget it's there.  Gentlemen - tuck it inside your inside shirt (if you wear one), or a pocket or wherever).  Refrain from going overboard on your walking this first week just because you know you're wearing a pedometer.<br /><br />Then take your average steps for the week and figure out what that would equate to each day (divide by 7).  Increase your \\""normal\\"" daily step count by a little bit. (For this example, let's say your daily average step count was 1,500 ... try to increase it to 2,000 to start).  Make yourself a commitment to walk at this \\""new\\"" pace for 1-2 weeks.  Then increase your daily step count by 500 steps (in my example, you would increase it to 2,500 now).  Walk at your new pace again for 1-2 weeks. Wash, rinse, repeat.  The next thing you realize you're at 10,000+ steps and feeling awesome!  It's not too fast of an increase, so (for me), my asthma didn't flare up and my body wasn't incredibly sore (I felt pleasantly sore, but was well able to move about without pain).<br /><br />I also find that I tend to fall asleep with this on simply because I forget it's there (warning:  take it off before you get into the shower, pool, hot tub, etc.)<br /><br />Why the 4 stars instead of 5?  Their mobile app right now is having a bit of issue.  It used to sync flawlessly with my phone; however within the past month \\""something\\"" happened and it can, at times, be a bit of a chore to get it to sync.  I've reinstalled the mobile app several times, killed it from my iPhone running apps, etc.  It's not horrible, but it could be better.  I'm hoping the developers will take a look and fix whatever is causing the issue.  From the reviews on the iPhone marketplace I'm not the only one who's encountered this little annoyance so I'm pretty sure they'll look into it.  Once that is fixed, this puppy will rate a full 5-stars for me.  For now, it gets docked a point.  :)<br /><br />  ** Update 6/21/2013:  iPhone app is still sub-par in terms of consistently syncing.  I sent an email to their tech support and received a rather generic reply of \\""we're so sorry you're having problems, here try this...\\"".  That's great FitBit, but what I'd REALLY like is for your developers to fix whatever code they broke in the app.  It used to work flawlessly. Now it's an annoyance. Fix it. Love, me.  :)  Doesn't affect how the actual device itself works, so again, I'm not docking the Zip for this. It's just the mobile app.<br /><br />  ** Update 7/28/2013:  Ok I've had it.

Reviews for the Apple mobile app show that as of today (7/28), out of 232 reviews for their \\""newest\\"" patch, they have a satisfaction rating of 2.5 out of 5 stars with folks complaining about the same thing I am.  If one cannot get this to sync reliably, what makes this device superior to a cheap pedometer you can buy in a store somewhere?  It doesn't.  Hence I've now taken my Amazon review down from 4 stars to 1 star. The entire purpose for me buying this device was the ability to track weekly goals and sync with friends, etc.  I have switched to an entirely different device and can say that overall I am much happier.<br /><br />I've finally yammered about this device so much to my husband that he's ordered a Flex to try out.  Now we can be a happy little FitBit family while walking ourselves healthier, together.  Doesn't get much better than that, does it?<br /><br />  **Update 7/28/2013:  My husband sent his Flex back (he also had syncing issues on his iPhone) and chose the same other brand of device that I have, and we are now much happier.

This particular model is totally unsuitable for the purpose.<br />First, it arrives in a closed donut shape. As it is wrapped tightly with plastic, one could assume that it will get to the normal crescent shape after opening. Not so... It will remain a donut. If you try to open it up to the required shape, it will wrinkle.<br />Then, the density is not sufficient. I gave it a personal try and laid on the table in the prone position. The headrest pad deflates to a very uncomfortable level.<br />Lastly, and perhaps the worst of it all, it won't stay on your headrest base as the pad velcro will likely not match the ones from the base.<br />I returned the item and got a prompt refund despite the fact that I had sent it back without the original packaging. Amazon is a great company. This is a bad product. If you need a more padded headrest, I suggest fleece pillows rather than this unsuitable product.<br />If you are looking for a pillow to sleep on your stomach, this might serve the purpose, but I doubt it, unless you use a snorkel.

I have later seen the same model marketed as a shipping scale, which might work better. I know it's absolutely not for clinical use with humans. With humans, the platform was not large enough to accommodate the human stance and feet, so people lost their balance. Undaunted, we installed grab bars on the wall near it. Still, people tended to put their feet such that all their weight was over only one side of the scale (where their ankles/heels were). And no, it is impossible to train staff to coach patients to stand in a way that feels completely unnatural. A few very obese patients later, and the springs on that side of the scale were shot, causing the platform to tilt even when nobody was on it. At first I managed this by rotating the platform when one side was down to try and distribute the wear. This temporizing worked at first, but less than a year later the scale was completely out of commission from  weighing the very kind of people the scale was originally sold for.  Note:  If it was a single household scale, there's a chance it might have lasted longer if they noticed and put the front of their feet about 4-6 inches  off the scale so the weight was in the center. Then again, it might not. Warranty? What warranty? Sure, they would replace the scale, less S&H, but it was no good for the use for which it was marketed. I will never again buy a scale -- no matter what the color or where I find it or what the label says it's for -- that has this particular platform with these markings on it, now that I know it's actually a shipping scale not designed to withstand regular use at even half its claimed capacity and inappropriately and/or falsely marketed for use with humans.",15816.0

I spent way more than I needed to for a massage chair because I wanted it to last through many massage therapists who volunteer using it. MISTAKE.<br /><br />Immediately the volunteers complained that it was wobbly (and it is --the pipe that holds it in place with the \\""C\\"" always wobbles, which is disconcerting to people who are already in pain or trauma). Across the board almost all of my massage volunteers hated the chair and it have refused to use it because they are afraid it is unstable.<br /><br />The ones who did try to use it kept trying to tighten it, which resulted within a few months of use the plastic pieces that allow for adjustment of the chest/torso support being cracked. It seems the pieces are cheap almost everything is made from plastic with metal screws. Additionally, the glue on the velcro used to adhere the $25.00 chest cushion piece was falling off immediately, which resulted in losing the pad for between the breasts during our move.<br /><br />You can imagine when women have had surgery for breast cancer we would like to give them support for their breasts as many have undergone multiple surgical procedures. When I contacted the company to replace the pieces they said they would. I sent them photos well, they didn't. So I put it to the top of my list again a few months later and called and finally they sent them out. Two plastic pieces and a new piece of velcro. That was it for the over 500 bucks I spent on an unusable chair.<br /><br />THEY WERE NOT GENEROUS ENOUGH TO REPLACE THE CHEAP CUSHION FOR THE BREAST THAT WAS LOST DUE TO THEIR POOR QUALITY SYSTEM OF ADHESION. Though I did ask. The owner refused the request.<br /><br />Considering we are a charity and they could have wrote it off as a product donation I was quite clearly surprised at their lack of generosity, and at the undue time I had to spend out of my work to contact and re contact them for pieces of a chair that I now have to fix myself. The chair has been mostly unused since I purchased it and considering their motto \\""serving those who serve\\"" I am not very happy with the company.<br /><br />Sad product, without a doubt the owners of the company are also not charitable towards those who serve.

Unless my specific unit is defective, it is made of extremely poor design and I would highly Not recommend to others. A major pro/selling point of this razor is that the angle is adjustable---well, this is of course referring to the angle of the blade edge with regards to its vertical approach to your face/whiskers---and this is indeed adjustable. The glaring problem/flaw is, that after trying over a dozen times (no exaggeration) at the outset of each of my half a dozen shaving attempts, I could not get the blade set into the razor in a straight position. Honestly, I could care less about adjustment of the vertical angle, if I cannot even start with a horizontally straight/parallel blade to shave with. I tried properly lining it up over and over again. I tried vertically putting the top piece down toward the handle piece until they met; I tried placing the top piece (with blade on inner posts) down on the counter and then lining up and affixing the handle piece down toward it until the two pieces met. Over and over again I tried, but could not get a completely parallel blade affixed between these two pieces.<br /><br />To better illustrate, imagine affixing the two pieces together and looking down at the blade and apparatus you have to work with---as the two edges of the double-edged blade peek out/extend slightly beyond the top/head piece, you would want to see 2 parallel blade lines/edges. Think train tracks. Two straight lines that could stretch on as is and never intersect. I've never once been able to achieve this with this razor. I've also tried numerous different blades (by various mfg's) so I know I am not repeatedly putting on blades that were not mfg. straight (plus, after failing at getting a blade on this razor in a straight position, I've been eventually just popping it out of the futur, putting the same blade inside my merkur 180 long handle, screwing the top in, finding myself with completely parallel blade edges and then enjoying a good shave).<br /><br />Even if only slightly offset in angle, no matter how many times I try affixing the blade into the futur and regardless of how many differing methods I attempted, I never once could achieve my parallel/train tracks blade edge position. Even if the offset was slight, if lines were drawn and extended for each of the blade edges they would eventually cross/intersect.<br /><br />I don't care that I can then vertically adjust the blade angle/approach, because I cannot achieve a horizontally straight blade to begin with. This is my sixth double edge razor and the only one I have poorly reviewed. In my experiences, screw in head pieces and then butterfly heads have been 1st and second best with regards to starting off with the blade being set in to a proper/straight blade angle. This futur, snap-together head-to-handle design has produced nothing but poor results for me. Also, the one time I went ahead (stupidly) and settled for setting in the blade as straight as I could possibly get it and then shaved, just as I suspected, as carefully as I tried, I ended up with more bloody nicks than I could count. One simply cannot shave well with blade edges that are not set at a straight, 180 degree angle, so this razor proved to be a big waste of $ and a small waste of time and blood for this guy.<br /><br />Recommend: Staying away from the Futur, unless I just happen to have a defective, ill-milled unit<br />Recommend: Merkur 180 Long Handle or Merkur 38C if you'd like more heft/weight in your razor.<br /><br />Thanks.",15586.0

Well, it did after 3 weeks and the button on the tube holder wouldn't retract anymore. So returned to Amazon for a full refund and bought another. This time I only had my small wife use it because she likes to roll them loose. Well, after 5 weeks this 2nd machine broke too. Same problem where the button won't retract anymore. But now it's too late for a refund.<br /><br />I would NOT buy this machine because there is a design flaw in the inside cheap plastic case and it won't last long at all. Reduced my rating from 4 stars to 1 since it's now junk. Will have to disassemble and see if I can't fix it myself. Wonder if others aren't having this same problem because the price keeps going down?? Buyers beware!<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />First off, don't believe you are going to get a blue Powermatic II as shown in the ad since it will be delivered with an all black case. Misleading on both Amazon and the vendor Hipsaurus's part.<br /><br />I've only had this machine for a couple weeks so the reliability cannot yet be determined. The machine has jammed but I would blame that on I like my tubes to be fairly tight/full. It's nice it stops when jammed and it's fairly easy to clear out with the small rod included. I'm somewhat concerned the handle you raise all the way does not click twice when raising it all the way like it did when first new. And it's getting harder to raise fully so not sure if it's going to break or not. I may end of trying to put some type of fine oil on the handle base where it pivots to see if it helps. Maybe fine tobacco has gotten down in he cracks where it attaches.<br /><br />My wife loves the machine and can really crank the tubes out fast. She doesn't pack them as full and the machine is a whole lot easier on her wrists/hands. She wishes I would have bought the electric Powermatic II a long time ago and I would have to agree.<br /><br />As with any tube-injector type machine you might as well throw that 'shake' away out of your bags/off the table. It will only jam in the machine and doesn't burn/smoke well anyhow.<br /><br />Just a tip on storing large (16oz) bags of tobacco. I'll take one of my wife's small plastic disposable contact lens canisters they come in and drill three 1/8\\"" holes in the cap and one in the bottom. Then I'll put a cotton swab/round inside, add water until it doesn't drip out anymore, and put it in the middle of the bag. Since most tobacco is extremely dry this will add a little moisture and cut down on the amount of fine 'shake' as it's being handled. Just change the cotton round every couple weeks, clean the canister/holes, and add some more water.<br /><br />At this point I would recommend the Supermatic II injector machine and it's a whole lot easier to use than a manual machine. Feels like it has good power too.<br /><br />BTW, there is a DVD included in the box which shows you how to use the machine.",15552.0

Press and release CH+ (or CH-) button until TV shuts off.<br />5. Press MUTE button immediately after TV shuts off to complete the Tek Pal set-up.<br /><br />Even though those instructions looked clear to me, and I thought I had followed them, the remote didn't work (judging by the ratings on Amazon, I think I represent the minority of purchasers who misinterpret the instructions).<br /><br />Here is my misinterpretation: in step #4, I held the CH+ button down until the TV shut off, then I pressed \\""MUTE\\"". The remote didn't work, despite repeating the set-up 15 times. I finally figured out that you need to repeatedly press and release the CH+ button until the TV shuts off (do you see the difference in button pushing?), and then press the MUTE button.<br /><br />Apparently what is going on is the remote has several hundred different \\""device codes\\"" in its memory, and you are trying them one by one each time you press CH+, until one demonstrates that it works by turning off the TV.  Pressing \\""MUTE\\"" confirms that you want to use the last code you tried.  (When I held the CH+ button down, it probably skipped ahead to the next code as the TV was turning off, so I was confirming an incorrect code.)  I called the manufacturer and explained that it is possible to misinterpret the instructions, but I was told that the instructions were too simple to misinterpret, so there was no need to revise them!<br /><br />The first time I found a code that \\""worked\\"" for my Samsung TV, I found that in order to turn my TV on I had to press the ON/OFF button twice (everything else worked normally).  Later, I re-did the set-up, and apparently found a different code that turned on the TV with a single push of the ON/OFF button.

I read all of the literature to make sure I knew how to use it properly.  It always seemed like it read about a degree low so I used for the first 9 months with that in mind. Then my daughter got sick when she was about 9 months old (turned out to be an ear and sinus infection). I checked her several times throughout the day and it said she was running a little fever (about 101 degrees).  She seemed more sleepy than usual for the middle of the day and I thought it was just because she wasn't feeling well.  We finally decided to check her rectally with a cheapy digital thermometer because she felt warmer than 101.  We were shocked (and terrified) when it read 106.  We raced her to the hospital and their expensive thermometer confirmed our 106 reading.  Fortunately they got her cooled down within a few hours and and got an antibiotic started and she was fine.  I will NEVER use the Exergen thermometer again.,15379.0

This is not a keratin treatment product.  It is a chemical relaxer or straightening perm.  That is all there is to it.  It does not make your hair glossy, healthy, or smooth.  It damages your hair in the same way a perm does.  The Suave website recommended I use the product based on my hair type etc. Used it exactly as directed.  My hair was fried in twenty minutes.  Trying to reverse the product using sulfates and sodium chloride does not work as this is NOT a keratin treatment.  It is perm solution.  Went to the salon to try to salvage what I had left, cut 2 1/2 inches off all over (my hair was just above my shoulders)and did conditioning treatment.  I told my stylist what I had done and she said that she could still smell perm solution in my hair (after I had washed it six times with sulfates and sodium chloride throughout the week).  Even after my hair was finished she could still smell it.  Again, this is not a keratin treatment (from what I understand Keratin or Brazilians do not smell).  How they can market it and convince people that this is a keratin treatment is beyond me.  If you've used it and had this type of result (I have naturally curly hair) go to the salon, get a short layered undercut, have them blow dry your hair straight and then curl it, and invest is some really good conditioning treatments.  A good cut really can give you some resemblancce of your hair back until it grows out (yes, I said grows out...this is a perm people).  Good luck:)",15377.0

Amazon tells me I may post here even if I did not buy the product. My rating is based on the sense I am been lied to, and my best guess that this review page is infected by fake reviews. I am making no accusations, however.   I noticed right off that 15 out of 16 reviews were 5-star, with not a single 1-3 star reviews, That in itself, while not suspicious, is still unusual for here. I also noted the slick sounding advertisement-like nature of the comments and the simple reviewer names that give the impression of spam artists. So I decided to dig further by looking at the \\""see all my reviews\\"" tabs. I was struck by the fact that several of the reviewers had given 5-star reviews to other Ozeri products, all with the same eager-beaver type of comments, but otherwise have very few other product reviews. They never mention the slightest reservation, and all have a canned sounding quality. The multiple-Ozeri positive reviewers seem to have been especially taken by the Ozeri Pepper Mill. But who knows, maybe people who like bathroom scales also like pepper Mills. A few others were for kitchen scales, including one case where two different Ozeri kitchen scales are described as \\""must haves\\"" by the same reviewer. Why is it so urgent to have 2 different Ozeri kitchen scales? This was not enough to convince me of anything, but it did activate an alarm bell. The final factor was the ease and speed with which I found further evidence: out of curiousity I plugged into Google the words \\""Ozeri\\"" and \\""deceptive\\"". I was immediately directed to a site with the following user comment:   \\""Yes. Additionally, it was pointed out that a significant number of the positive reviews on Amazon were fake reviews\\""  and   \\""That these threads are always posted by New Members makes me suspicious. That and the allegedly fake reviews. There's no way to prove anything, but when I went through the reviews myself it raised enough doubts in my mind that I did not buy any scales from Ozeri.\\""  and  \\""I bought the scale on the last deal before the issue of fake reviews came up.

I ended up with a twisted piece of foam-coated metal that my hair slid out of. After a few tries, the metal was twisted out of shape. When I started to get the hang of it, I thought it might work.

Once the gel has been squeezed to the edges it is pretty near impossible to work it back to the top of the pad where you need it.  I may try the memory foam next.

The first thought in your mind is to bring the end of the rubber insert as close to the base of the shaft as possible so as to avoid any possible leakage when a forceful urge comes upon you. When you find that this is near impossible to accomplish you try to stretch the rubber hole around your penis only to have it snap violently back.

So, that's great and all, but very frequently after a half hour or so, the Zephyr will tell me that my heart rate has dropped way down - for example, from 160 to 80.  It's so irritating and makes me completely lose focus on my run when I hear the thing announce such a low heart rate.  It'll often happen during a very difficult part of the run when I'm really pushing myself, so it's especially distracting when I know my HR has got to be getting close to the max and the thing tells me it's at 80.  I end up slowing way down and futzing with the unit, re-positioning the strap, unsnapping and resnapping the module, etc.  Sometimes the HR will get back to normal again, but it's typically a bit messed up from that point on.    I've followed all of the suggestions that are on the Zephyr web site, including wetting the strap, making sure it's tight enough, and positioned high enough.  I've also had several different phones in the time I've owned the Zephyr HXM, and this problem is consistent across all of them.  I believe that the problem is happening after I've worked up a good sweat - it seems to mess things up when it gets too wet.  Another reviewer, \\""S. Cronin\\"", had this same problem, so it's not unique to me.    I have sent 4 emails to support over the past several months, and they haven't answered a single one.  I posted on their forum and this has not been answered either.  I believe they're ignoring me because they know that this issue has no solution. Either that or they just don't care to answer emails from their customers.  Either way, it's not a good sign that the company won't take the time to answer a customer who is having issues.     I finally got so fed up with it that I went out and bought a Garmin 610 with HR monitor, abandoning the tracking-runs-using-my-phone concept altogether.  The Garmin is working great.  The HR readings have all been accurate with no sudden drop-outs.  I do miss having the voice cues, but I'm willing to sacrifice them in the interest of accuracy.  I'll just have to get used to looking at my wrist for HR data.    I recommend staying far away from this product.  For me, I think it's done more harm than good - it is incredibly distracting having an inaccurate HR announced to you, especially when it happens when you're really exerting yourself.  There are a bunch of positive reviews out here, and I can't say why they haven't seen the issues that I have, but there are also several negative reviews.  Maybe myself and the other negative reviewers just have a faulty units.  If that's the case, I still can't get through to anybody at the company to replace it, and at this point I don't even care to.  Maybe my HR runs higher than the people who don't have issues, and it's confusing the unit & causing the bad data.  Who knows - all I know is I can't get through to anybody to troubleshoot it, I've completely given up on the HXM and the Zephyr company in general, and will be tossing this one in the trash heap.  It was a complete waste of time & money.  My advice is to stay far, far away from this one.  Maybe the bluetooth HRM from Polar is better......    ---------------------  **UPDATE 7/21/11: I finally heard from Zephyr.  They never did answer any of my emails to the support address, but I decided to give it one last try and sent an email to the address they give for requesting an RMA# to return a unit.  I received instructions on how to return it, and they will be sending me a new one.  Hopefully the new one doesn't have the issues that my original did.  So, I'm glad that I finally heard from them and that they're willing to replace the unit, but the whole lack of answering any of the emails to support, or to the two individual addresses that I had tracked down still leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth...  I can't say for sure if the new one will have the issues that the old one had, but I'll post my findings and will modify the review accordingly.",15174.0

If you are purchasing it to relieve the pain of plantar fasciitis, don't waste your time or your money. It doesn't work!<br /><br />I have been suffering from plantar fasciitis in both feet for 2 yrs now & was willing to try anything. So I did some research online & decided to try a night splint. This particular splint can not do anything to help plantar fasciitis because there is no way for it to stay where it belongs due to the way it's designed. Because the leg tapers from the calf to the ankle, it keeps sliding down your leg defeating the purpose of what the splint is supposed to do. If you make the straps tight enough to keep it in place, it cuts off the circulation & your toes go numb. The ankle strap is very short, so if you have big calves, it won't fit you. Also beware of the vendor's return policy, I wasn't able to return the splint because I tried it on.<br /><br />I did order a different splint that is totally different from this one, but haven't received it yet. One thing that I did find that really helped is different shoes. I have been using the arch supports in all of my shoes up until now with no relief from the pain. Somebody told me to try a fitness sneaker with the rocker bottoms, that their foot doctor told them that they help with the plantar fasciitis. So I went shopping for a pair and ended up buying 2 different brands. The first was a Danskin brand that had a higher rocker bottom that wern't very comfortable. The second was Dr Scholl's Personal Trainers with a Gel heel pad. I highly recommend these to anyone with plantar fasciitis, they have really helped. I even went back & bought 3 more pair. They are a lower profile fitness sneaker & are much easier to walk in. They feel weird at first, but after a day or 2 you don't even know that they're rocker bottom sneakers. I couldn't believe how much they reduced the amount of pain that I had at the end of the day.

Although the heading says \\""Moore Med. antimicrobial stethoscope COVERS RED-each\\"".     The PRICE of $9.31, word COVERS, & the DISPLAY picture showed 4 pieces made me decide that it was for 1 pkg of 4 pc covers (as I usually buy it in a pkg which contain 4-pc covers usually with assorted or solid colors).There should have been a disclaimer stating,'picture shows 4 but sale is for 1 cover\\"" or something to that effect. although,the price per each is still way too expensive to think it's for 1 cover only.    1 stethoscope diaphragm cover for $9.31 + $7.99 shipping that I need to throw away after a week's use does not make any sense. I bought this along with other Amazon items since I'm trying to make use of my Prime membership which I joined to save on shipping. Therefore, I am annoyed that here I am receiving an item that cost me $17.30 which I could have bought for $1.11/piece in another website with less than 5 bucks shipping cost.    It is not cost effective to spend $17.30 for a cover when in fact you could buy a whole stethoscope  for 14.99.     Anyway, on a positive note, the seller refunded the whole amount promptly and let me keep the 1 cover they sent (I wanted to return it even though I'll pay shipping initially).    I think that this item in this sale is way too expensive compared to what most of the other web sites offer for same trademark.",15126.0

Very first usage showed what a joke this product is.  (By \\""joke\\"" I mean that literally as I was actually laughing at how bad this product was made.)      Pulling it out of the box, one of the suction cup pieces had popped off.  No big deal, I pressed it back in and put it on my shower floor.

At this point I know I will return this item but I want to see how it would work if it was actually constructed properly, so I very carefully slide my foot back in and slowly start the scrubbing motion.  (It feels ok but definitely not luxurious by any sense of the word.) Well the suction cups really don't hold this thing in place very well.  As I moved my foot forward and back the easyfeet moved right along with it.  It didn't actually pop off the floor but just slid back and forth.  After that fiasco I finish my shower and then try and pop the easyfeet scrubber off my floor so I can put it somewhere to dry out.  Wouldn't you know the easyscrubber comes off the floor but leaves 4 suction cups sticking to the floor.  (It was at this point I just started laughing out loud at this whole mess of a product.)

Trusting the single five star review that was available here at Amazon, I was confident that I had found a way for my mother to initiate contact with her old friends rather than having to wait for them to call. I was utterly disappointed. The Dialer dialed okay, but it almost always dialed the wrong number. Its voice recognition capabilities were pathetic. In other words, my mother would speak one name and the device would dial a number not associated with that name. If Amazon made available a zero star review I would choose that since the Vocally device proved to be completely useless. The only positive about the device was that the manufacturer did accept its return without much argument. Perhaps I somehow got a lemon, but that's really no excuse. The Vocally is a simple device and a non-functioning unit should not get out the door. Frankly, since the Vocally has a very short warranty, I would not want to own a device from a manufacturer with such bad quality control even if my unit had chanced to work; I would be concerned about its short term, never mind its long term, reliability.",15077.0

Whenever I am here I like to grow my beard out, but it becomes quite unruly after awhile. So I decided to do some \\""manscaping\\"" and invest in some moustash wax. I bought this stuff after reading the reviews, becuause it seemed like everyone really liked it. Well, I guess all of the reviwers were 90 year old men. Because this is what this stuff will make you smell like. Actually, that is all you will be able to smell as you apply this stuff to the hair patch directly below you nose. Other reviwers said the smell was odd at first, but was ok. This is not true. The smell is horrible and embarassing. Others will notice the smell and I am sure assume you have not bathed in 4-5 days. If you are concerned about how you smell, and about how others react to how you smell, do not buy this wax. If you live in a shed by yourself in the middle of the woods and don't have to impress anyone, you should consider this. It would be a useful exercise for prepping to get a 90 year old male roommate as well.     Smell aside, the overall \\""stash shaping\\"" ability of this wax (I carefully followed the instructions), is also lacking. If you apply as directed, you will end up with a moustache that is too rigid, and smells. If I could give this product -2 stars it would be better.     I contacted the manufacturer and they offered me a refund, however mailing anything bigger than a letter over here is expensive and time consuming, not to mention that they would probably not let me ship it, as the dogs that search the mail for contraban would get confused and think someone is mailing a 90 year old man.    Bottom line. If you are a 93 year old man, buy this stuff, it will make you smell 3 years younger.

When you drill the second hole, offset it a hair or two so that the extension length will be that one hair longer than what you marked so that it will be tight when you put the nail in; in other words, offset it just that one hair so that it will be difficult to push the nail in.",15043.0

I tried using this over a two week period and simply could not get the hang of it.  I would pinch the contact and rarely would the contact actually leave my eye.  When it did manage to remove the lens it slipped off and fell.  Not good because I do this in the mirror over the sink. It just doesn't seem to hold the lens.    I did learn one thing by using this and that is you simply remove the lens by placing the  thumb (of the hand on that side of the eye, left eye, left hand)  on one side of the lens and the index finger on the other side of the lens. Sweeping the index finger towards the thumb will cause the lens to fold in half and it will be pinched between the two fingers and thus the lens will come away from the eye. You can also sweep the lens to the outer corner of the eye and then grabbing it there.    Another trick is to take the opposite hand, reach over your head to the opposite eye, and pull the eye lid up (right hand, left eye).  Use the fourth finger on the hand you are using to remove the lens (left hand, left eye) to pull the lower lid down.  This exposes a large portion of the eye thus allowing your thumb and index finger to do their job.  Use the same technique to insert the lens but this time just use the tip of the index finger to balance the lens and then move it slowly onto the eye.  I have to mentally prepare myself just prior to putting the lens against my eye because I naturally want to shut my eye while I'm doing it.  That's also why it helps to use the opposite hand to pull the eyelid up and the fourth finger to pull the lower lid down.    An excellent instructional video is available at:     [...]",15042.0

It is Made in China product and anyone can glue to it their name.  The device makes fraudulent claims about its capabilities and specifications. Any claims of beneficial actions must be fraudulent as well since the physical specifications of the device do not support any claim of being similar to professional medical devices. Let alone that the professional medical devices have been proven ineffective with exception of bone fracture. Regardless - any benefit of ultrasound treatment does not show before 10 - 12 weeks daily treatment.  Those who claim and heating effect and those who claim pain relief after two weeks of use are mistaken. The results are not the effect of this device - they are placebo effects or effects equal to massage action not the ultrasound. This device specifications as stated by its manufacturer/distributor are not capable of generating warming effect for several reasons: (1) the device allegedly generates pulse ultrasound wave of 2 ms duration in pulses -- only continuous wave generating device can create warming effect. (2) The manufacturer states that maximum power is 4 Watts. This is very unlikely. The 4 Watts is the maximum power supplied by the power supply (little transformer - the wall wart) so it cannot be the power coming out at the shiny probe. (3) The manufacturer claims that the device probe areas is 6.16 sq. cm, while in fact it is more than 8 sq. cm. (4) this means that manufacturer claims of having Maximum Effective Intensity of 1.57 Watts per sq. cm. is false. Factually it is at best 4 Wats/8 sg.cm = 0.5 W/sq. cm. (5) ultrasound devices with such low effective intensity are not effective at all. Professional equipment has about 2.5 W/sq. cm.    I would suggest Amazon removes this device for false advertising, not because medical claims are unproven, but because the device's specification is untrue and therefore misleading.

Very disappointed to find the recommended method of sitting for good balance, is to straddle the seat. This is NOT a product for use by females who wear dresses or skirts, as many older ladies do, every day.    The model on the manufacture's brochure is wearing capri pants. Don't let the advertising fool you. And notice she is a young model who probably has no type of disability.    Getting up and down from the seat requires healthy back and leg muscles.    Was told at the Post Office that I would need to pay for return shipping on this item. Not worth the hassle!!! They would not let me tape up the box and refuse the shipment since I had signed for the package, and had tried to walk with the cane. Plus, they wanted to charge me four dollars for a roll of tape.    Guess this cane would be ideal for a Man, since they are comfortable sitting straddle. But what decent Woman wants a pole sticking up from between her legs in public?    Another bad feature is using the cane as a walking stick. I mean, which one of these three pegs is the one to put on the floor? This wobbly thing rocks and wiggles back and forth.    THIS ADJUSTABLE SEAT CANE IS NOT STURDY. IT IS DANGEROUS AND USELESS FOR PEOPLE WITH MOBILITY PROBLEMS.    This product may be just fine for a young person to take on a long walk, or for a guy who needs to wait in line for concert or sports tickets. But this is not a product for the injured or handicap. The tips of the three legs are rounded instead of flat.    Sure wish someone would have warned me before ordering. I noticed that most of the five-star reviews were from male customers or from females who purchased the product for a male. The seat is very difficult, for a person with weak hands, to open and close.    By the way. . . if anyone has figured out how to use the cane as a walking stick, please explain for the next person who may be considering thisproduct. Thanks in advance for your help.

It's simple...they never use them and haven't a clue what they do.<br /><br />So here is my bottom line...don't buy a fresnel lense product as a reading aid--it could destroy your vision.  In additon...the acrylic plastic molded magnifiers use to be used in 'first telescope and binoculars lenses and mirrors--they worked just fine and probably cost less then the fresnel lense.<br /><br />Final though...the reviewers saying the product doesn't magnifying are correct...I calculate less than 1/2 magnification--it's worthless.<br /><br />However, for those of you who already own this junk...keep it.

Don't let it be on you.,"This review concerns the product itself, not the seller, and certainly not Amazon, which I love. I snore loudly and have medically diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, as well. The manufacturer claims that this product can cure apnea, and it is supposed to maintain an open nasal airway, as I understand it. I have been recommended to wear a CPAP machine, but of course I resisted wearing that monstrosity. Seeking an alternative remedy, I ordered this Snorepin, to at least keep my nose/nostrils open. This product, which in my personal opinion should have cost 25 cents, did absolutely nothing for me other than give me a good laugh at myself for purchasing it. It reminds me of something we used to get in a gumball machine as kids. How they can justify a price of over $20 mystifies me. It fell out within minutes after I fell asleep. I know this because my wife heard my usual snoring, turned on the light to investigate how this thing was working, or not working, and noticed the device was gone. We found it on the sheets. I showed it to my physician, who seemed quite amused with it as well. I tried it for two more nights, just to be fair, with similarly uninspiring results. It did at least irritate my nostrils enough to let me know when it was still in my nose. Well, the joke was on me, so live and learn, I guess. I now use the CPAP and get a great night's sleep and feel much better. Here's my advice as a patient- If you have a serious condition like apnea, listen to your physician and use the CPAP if he so orders you to. If you just have routine snoring, buy and use a humidifier/vaporizer. In any case, avoid wasting your money on these \\""novelties\\"". I wish that I had.",14988.0

I'm convinced that most of the reviews are biased and written by the company or its employees. As the old saying goes \\""BUYER BEWARE\\"".<br /><br />Almost 6 months have passed and my knees are at least 90% better but not due to the inferno crap. I spent $110 and bought a good TENS/EMS unit and used it 3 times a week for a half hour each time after doing therapeutic exercises. Before working out I used a small rolling pin (similar to a \\""stick\\"" - another ripoff overpriced item) and massaged my legs for a few minutes before working out. When I finished I immediately used ice packs for 5-6 minutes which I held in place with ace bandages. About an hour after working out I would use the TENS/EMS unit. The important thing is to start very slowly with 3-4 exercises (1 set) and very gradually increase plus add more exercises.<br /><br />Presently I do 2 sets of 10 reps of 7 exercises plus 7 minutes on the bike and 7 minutes on the treadmill. This is about half of what I used to do before my injuries but my physical therapist warned me to slowly increase things only once a week for the next few months. Some occasional pain is normal as you are healing.

Then the other day I was watching Discovery Green channel and it was showing an episode of \\""How do they do that\\"". The episode featured water bottle manufacturing. In the episode, it showed how the metal is cut and formed into a bottle. The forming process requires an oil-based liquid to lubricate the shaping process. After shaping, it is necessary to throughly clean (with hot water and detergent) the oil and any minute, loose metallic particles (a result of shaping) from the interior and exterior of the bottle. But most interesting is that after the bottle is shaped, a water-bottle is sprayed with a plastic-lining and heated to 400F to seal the lining. In the episode, it explained that the lining is necessary to prevent any metallic taste from permeating the water.    ....a lining is necessary to prevent any metallic taste from permeating the water....    I went back to my junk pile to reinspect my Earthlust water bottle. Here is what I found: the interior of the bottle is unlined and somewhat rough. If I applied pressure on the surface of the interior with my finger nail, I could dislodge small metallic particles.    I thought that maybe my bottle was the exception. I went back to the same store where I purchased the Earthlust bottle, and the other Earthlust bottles had no lining and metallic particles coming off of the interior.    At this point Iwent to WalMart to check out there water bottles...and I was shocked. WalMart's steel and aluminum water bottles had the plastic lining. In fact, some of the bottles advertised \\""Nalgene-free/BPA-free\\"" lining as a selling point.    Now I am just sick to my stomach. and the WalMart bottle were only $5-$10.    I feel totally hosed by Earthlust, but then again, nuts on me for buying a product with the word \\""lust\\"" in the name.",14979.0

We were immediately sorry.<br /><br />Our first complaint was the positioning of the upper and lower vibrators. The upper vibrator rested on the mons pubis (so there was no direct contact with the clitoris) while the lower vibrator rested just past the Gr&auml;fenberg Spot (so there was no direct contact with it, either).  Yes, the vibration was fantastic, but it failed to vibrate the proper places.  We always thought women's vaginas were pretty much shaped the same, but it appears the WeVibe II was created with a different shaped woman in mind.<br /><br />Our second complaint was the slipperiness of the unit. My wife likes to employ her Kegel muscles during intercourse, so the WeVibe kept popping out.  If she laid completely still and didn't move or flex, the unit stayed in place (though it failed to stimulate her), but at the slightest movement, it immediately popped out.  So, if you or your partner use Kegel muscles, then forget using the WeVibe II.<br /><br />Our final complaint was the thickness of the unit's curve.  We were told that the WeVibe II could be used during intercourse.  In our case, this was not true.  In fact, the unit pressed so hard against my penis that it made it impossible to continue intercourse (unless one enjoys discomfort during sex).<br /><br />Needless to say, after only a few frustrating minutes, we knew we had thrown our money away.  If the unit had only cost 5 cents, it would not have been worth the money, let alone fifty dollars.  While it may be true that it works on some women, our own experience proves that it does not work well on everyone.  This is definitely NOT a \\""one size fits all\\"" type of sex toy.",14959.0

This device does not work properly.    It's now midnight. My wife is holding our sick two year old upstairs so he'll sleep. Two hour ago I went down to the Walgreens and bought this device because the rectal thermometer made my son cry. It had showed a temperature of 103 earlier in the evening. I needed to know if it was getting worse, and I knew it would be miserable for my boy if I had to keep measuring him rectally.    So I tried this one. First, on myself several times, where the measured temperature varied between 96 and 97.5. Then on my wife, where it varied from 97 to 98.9. Then we tried on my child, in dim light, while my wife held him. I put the thermometer on his forehead and pressed the button. The red light flashed in his eyes, the beep went off, and he shrieked.    What kind of idiot would put a bright red LED in the exact place where it would shine in a child's eyes? What kind of idiot would make it impossible to turn off the beep when you're trying to measure a sleeping child?    He struggled. Finally we pinned his arms and tried it twice. 97 then 98 degrees. This measure was wildly wrong. He felt like he was burning up. And another stick with the rectal showed that his fever just a little lower than before, not five degrees.    I read the instructions thoroughly and followed the procedure accurately. The instructions are, like the packaging, filled with hype, and repeatedly try to sell you on the idea that their measurement method is accurate. Why would someone feel the need to put doctor testimonials in the instruction booklet?    This product is a fraud, and what's more, it's a dangerous one.

That is until I loaded the instructional DVD that looked like it had been filmed 20 years ago. Also, using it, it was VERY uncomfortable to insert, as well as pull out. It's made out of a very hard plastic, it looks very cheaply made, it's obvious it did not cost much to make, so why it has a $100 price tag, I'm unsure. It would have been better if they had some kind of soft rubber coating for more comfort. I started off with just the 1 spring, as recommended, and it did nothing. I guess I needed to add a second spring for it to give more resistance. Well, when I pulled it out, the kegelmaster snagged or got stuck on something inside of me (I didn't push it in further than it told me to). Ugh!!

I've compared the Temporal Scanner to two digital thermometers (which give the same reading), and the Temporal Scanner is always off by a few degrees.    Interestingly, if you take your own temperature a few times quickly, the readings are usually off +/- .2 degrees between readings (a good thing). If you wait a minute to take your temperature again, the readings are now off +/- 1.0 degrees (a bad thing).    One reason for these varied readings is because you may be sweating. The manufacturer does warn that the Temporal Scanner doesn't really work if you sweat. Keep in mind that most people with fevers sweat. So what is a sweating person to do? In this case, the instructions tell you to scan below your ear to get a reading (which ear they do not say). At this point, you will discover that your under the ear temperature varies significantly with all the other readings you have taken. So which one is accurate?     The Temporal Scanner is also very touchy. You have to run the scanner across your forehead EXACTLY the same way or your readings will be very different. Unless you are perfect, this is a challenging task. To make matters worse, taking readings on another person even more difficult.    I too have talked to \\""experts\\"" in the field of medicine, and they will admit that the Temporal Scanners are only approximations, and not as accurate as the old standby digital thermometers. Also, keep in mind that these same experts have much better Temporal Scanners than the one I'm reviewing here.     Bottom line: skip the Temporal Scanner if an accurate reading matters to you.",14926.0

At that it could possibly serve as a support for a small to mid-sized book providing the reader was prepared to tolerate the incessant vertical bounce of the tray every time a page was turned. Forget trying to eat a meal off of the soggily supported tray surface - it would end up somewhere other than intended - and risking a beverage on this teeter-totter would be  a surefire recipe for disaster. When the product is used in a carpeted area it is absolutely doomed to failure. The combined weight of the chair and it's occupant press the flimsy base into the carpet at the point of contact of the chair leg, causing the tray to slope down away from the support to the extent that a plate placed thereon promptly slides to the floor.<br />The unit was purchased in this instance with the intention of supporting a computer monitor (weight 18#). It did perform this function but the monitor weight increased the slope of the tray to a ridiculous extent rendering it useless for the intended purpose. Worse yet, with an 18# load (out of a rated 50#) the swinging action of the tray was so stiff that it required an assistant to help swing the tray into position when sitting down and to swing it out again when standing up.

Nevertheless, it's not a waste of time for potential customers and the manufacturer to understand that, there is a fundamental design flow in the reservoir attachement mechanism that's shared between these two models.)    I've been using various countertop dental irragation units for 15+ years, so when I saw the cordless ones at Target I didn't hesitate for one second to give them a try.  I purchased the 30-sec Waterpik cordless water flosser but quickly came to find out that it was difficult to put the reservoir and the power handle together.  The new hell of buyer's remorse didn't stop there: while following the instruction manual (on page 11) to remove the reservoir from the power handle, nothing moved at all.  No clicking sound, no fissure , not any identifiable indication to show that the unit is parting itself as the manual suggested it would.    For this reason I had to return the Waterpik cordless water flosser.    I will remain a faithful customer to Waterpik but please spend more time in designing a cordless unit that's more easily to assemble and remove.  I understand this is not a piece of m-16 that our lives depend on it if we couldn't accomplish putting it together in 5 seconds with a blindfold on, but just be reminded that one of your veteran customers came up short while attempting to take better care of the flosser unit.",14893.0

Busted! *READ IT*,"Allow me to relay an experience I had with a sales rep at the local fair recently, which may be illuminating.     I was wandering through the sales tent with my girlfriend, and paused in front of a booth with stacks of these wristbands, official PB sales material, and photos of star athletes with PB bling on their wrists.    \\""Have you heard of the PB wristband?\\"" Salesman (as of then) asked.    \\""No, what is it?\\""    \\""It's embedded with a positively charged hologram that reacts with certain frequencies in the Earth to improve balance, strength and flexibility\\"".    My GF rolled her eyes and wandered on. \\""So it has a battery?\\"", I asked.    \\""No, no battery, it's built in, and lasts forever. A lot of pro athletes are wearing them [drops some names]. We demonstrate how it works through some simple kinesthetic tests\\"".    [Knowing something how electricity works, I was skeptical to say the least. Charged ions do not stay put when touched by a person, this is why we get static shocks, lightning, and functional household appliances, but I humored the man].    \\""Stand on one foot and hold your arms out, and resist and hold your balance when I push down on your arm.\\""    I did so, attempting not to jab any passersby. He pushed, and I fell over. [No, not all the way]. One more time (to make sure it's not muscle memory, he says), and same result. Then I put on a PB band, and wouldn't you know it, he's practically hanging off my arm and I'm still standing!    \\""Well, that's pretty nifty, I'll go read up on them and might be back.\\""    So we walked  the fair that night, and a day or two later I read up on PB. I read amazing testimonials, saw the same test being performed on astounded people on YT vids. Then I watched the YT video put out by the Australian Skeptic organization and saw the early Board Riders Review of PB, where you can clearly see that yes, those skeptical Australians are in fact on to something. I also learned that to receive the electro-magnetic frequency PB claims it does, because of the wavelengths involved the bracelet would need to be 12,000 miles long or so. But -    Here's how the \\""tests\\"" work, try it and amaze your friends with any prop! I have... [But don't stop now, the story continues below]! Without bracelet, the salesman errr conman rather, pushes down, and while maintaining pressure pulls off balance ever so slightly. With band on, he pushes straight down and can even push in slightly if the target starts to tip. With correct downward pressure, it's very difficult to notice being pulled, esp when you're focusing on balancing. Next test is similar, your hands on one side, he pulls down and out first time, and straight down next time. And lastly, when the target is completely amazed (and thus also utilizing the basic sales principle of \\""commitment and consistency\\"", where a person will go to great lengths to uphold a previously conceived notion, even fooling themselves subconsciously) comes the flexibilty \\""test\\"" where you point, twist, and hold (thus also stretching), put on the band and point, and lo! You point further!    So I practiced up, amazed friends and family and sold them all worthless pieces of gravel for $50 [Only kidding about the last part! Had to clarify since I know there are probably a few gullible people reading this...] Then I went back to the fair days later, intending only to go on the rides which we missed before. Well, just maybe looking for a confrontation as a bonus...    We happened to walk by the conman in action, joined by an accomplice this time. Fearing a scene, my lady moved along. I stood off to the side, a naive observer who he didn't recognize, and made small talk with his brother-in-scammetry while Conman One finished with his target. This guy was sold, and as he was picking out what color he wanted I stepped up.    \\""Excuse me, don't you think an independent observer should do the pushing down, you know, since he IS the salesman?\\""    Well sure, the guy agreed, and the conman, well what choice did he really have? Besides with Commitment and Consistency on his side, the target would probably make it work on his own. So he thought. Heheh!    Well wouldn't you know it, I was completely unable to topple the man when he didn't have the bracelet on, using two fingers.    \\""Two fingers!\\"" said the conman. \\""What does that prove!?\\""    \\""Yeah yeah, now give him the gizmo\\"" I requested, and under protest he turned it over.    Same two fingers, and boy. The positive charge must have grounded out, because the target toppled over quicker than a drunk on the midway rides, bracelet and all!     \\""You're pulling him over! You pulled him over!\\"" yells the conman.    \\""And you're not?\\""    Not even a denial, just \\""Well, OK, how do explain the flexibility tests then! I wasn't even touching him!\\""    I did, we exchanged a few more unpleasantries, and I turned to the target, suggesting that whatever he decided to do, he look up PB and applied kinesiology when he got home. Then I turned to leave.    As I walked by Conman One, he snarled under his breath, \\""Don't try to ruin our sale!\\"" And I smiled.    Oh Conman, I will. And happy ending, the would be target ran up behind us moments later, sans bracelet with words of appreciation.    Now you know, and since you do, the next time YOU see one of these sleazies in action, do what I did and spoil just one sale. What are they really going to do? It kills me that these shiny pieces of rubber are #4 in \\""sports and fitness\\"" right now! They are completely unrelated to either! You want fitness, you gotta work for it, you want self help, buy some Tony Robbins.

Three months of very light use, and the Mangroomer is done...into the garbage it goes. The 30-day warrantee at this point is worthless.    Other than I would not buy another, here is my quick review:  It's cheaply made, I did not think the Mangroomer would last long anyway, but thought I could at least get a summer's use out of it.  The comb's teeth are too thick and tends to push hair away from the cutting blade.  The adjusting height of the comb guide is a joke...it ratchets on weak plastic tabs that do not hold it in place.  Used without the red comb, the blades cut well for bulk hair removal.  I never tried the foil.  I am going to take a look at other options now, I hope there is something decent out there...",14857.0

The company manufacturer, Pisces Productions, claimed that the Dolphin II could adjust to a horizontal postion, but most people find the postion to be uncomfortable. The Dolphin II massage chair is also very unstable in its poor design. It wobbles from side to side while you are working on people and some complain of motion sickness. I have also had the chest and face support slip out while I was giving a massage. Fortunatley the person was young and didn't recieve any injuries. All the clips that hold it together are made of plastic and one has already broke so I can no longer latch the chest and face support. I have had to replace all the velcro straps and I always need my tool set on hand so I can tighten it up. On top of all that the Dolphin II massage chair cost me around $700 back in '07 and it only had light to moderate use. For $700 it should sustain heavy use.

With my current Hydrofloss, I have to put pressure or weight (or my foot!) on the tank to make it work, and even with this drastic measure the flow is weak, not as strong as when the Hydrofloss is new. The picks themselves always break, and without much use. They seem to be very fragile and delicate. As for the service the company offers when the machine breaks, I cannot say I am happy either. When I explained to them that I had problems with the tank twice, they said that I was the only customer who had complained about it (hard to believe).

This last fact together with its large head makes shaving chin and mustache area virtually impossible. The final result is that even after a prolonged effort, you will receive a very uneven shave with some areas being appropriately close while other areas will be rough and feel un-shaved.

There does not appear to be any mapping, or terrain, or area covered with the details of routes and speed, no way points - nothing!    The \\""user\\"" manual that comes with the FT80 is hardly \\""useful\\"" and not worth the paper its printed on.  It's very sparse on the exact steps and explanations of features.  There are so many features of the FT80 and website interaction that are not documented, thatit will leave you researching and making calls for days on end until you get it figured out.    I still believe in Polars superior products overall, but the FT80 is a waste of money and time.    Sadly, the unit is near un-useable due to the display alone, not to mention the erratic behavior and poor GPS integration -- anybody want to purchase my \\""new\\"" FT80G1?

(This is due to the high pressure of the water)<br />- Then after no more than one minute, the whole thing pulls out of the faucet due to water pressure.<br />- The manufacturer suggests that you install a valve in the wall built in shower to turn it off while using the hand held shower so that no water will come out of the first. But I think this is a stupid suggestion because this happens due to high pressure and if you gonna prevent water from coming out from the first shower, the pressure will be even stronger on the hand held shower and will pull it out instantly!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Very easy installation with no tools.<br />- Did fit my square faucet.<br />- I have to say the water that comes out of the sprayer is really nice especially if used for a baby.<br />- Maybe this would work if the pressure of the water wasn't strong..

I have had extensive ringing in my left ear for almost 20 years due to having been in very close proximity to a small explosion. I've been to doctors, tried several diet changes (avoiding caffeine, alcohol, etc.) and have in since become vegetarian all together, also with zero difference to the ringing. I've seen countless tinnitus cure pills being advertised, especially in the past few years, and thought I would finally try one that seemed to be having positive results with people. Now I am about halfway through my third bottle (60 count), having gone the twice a day route (for faster results, as stated on the bottle) and I have noticed zero improvement. In fact, I'd even say that it's gotten worse, simply because Tinnitus sufferers know that the ringing is at it's worst when you are actively 'aware' of it, and reminding myself to take the pills several times a day does just that. Doing something that distracts you, such as listening to music or watching TV will work as a 'masker' and will redirect your focus from the ringing. Taking this pill however will redirect your focus back to the ringing, and this is a bad thing, especially before bed when the world is at it's quietest. So overall, I won't say this pill doesn't work for anyone, since some people seem to say it does, but it certainly does not work for me. Perhaps the severity of the condition will make the results of these herbal pills vary. I think people who have tinnitus due to isolated events such as an explosion or loud, quick noises such as gun fire, will not be happy with the results of this product.",14763.0

Extremely flimsy for the amount of money spent!! I am totally dissatisfied with this product beyond words!     It is a very poorly designed product. Any product designed for this task should have some features in common like; 1) it should rotate easily even with something sitting on it. Something this product just can not do. It skips, jumps, jerks and hangs up when rotation even with nothing on it.   2) It should adjust up and down easily with or without something sitting on it. It does neither.   3) It should not tilt to the side when small light objects are placed on it. It does this even with the lightest of objects on it. This is not because the chair it's placed under is to light, I have a very very heavy (400 lbs +) over sized recliner placed on it. The reason it tilts is that it only has enough surface area on the floor to fit under one corner of a chair. It should fit under at least 2 if not all 4 corners of the chair to remain stable!! The engineer that designed this should be fired!  4) you have to only order it for left or right hand. If designed correctly you could use it on either side. I may fix mine to work the way it should. It would be easy for me to do and I am not an engineer.  5) The price is as much as a nice kitchen table. Medical supply company's like to financially rape the disabled by charging 3 to 4 times what they should for poorly designed products.

However, I decided to try the Archtek one because it's cheaper and I had yet to try another brand.  That was a bad choice.  I'm writing this review in the morning after the third night of using it and my tooth on the right side of my mouth hurts from grinding it.  This grind guard is too hard.  What's more, it doesn't fit nearly as well, although I have used the \\""Hygiene Preferred\\"" guard for about a year now and have never had any trouble getting a good fit with any of those guards.  I suspect that this one didn't mold completely because it is too wide.  I do realize that part of the problem may be simply that it fits my mouth differently and that I am grinding more instinctively because of this foreign object in my mouth, but I feel like I'm having more trouble transitioning to this guard than I did to my very first grind guard.<br /><br />The bottom line is, I can't wait until my order of \\""Hygience Preferred\\"" grind guards comes in and I can throw away my current one.  My attempt to save some money has turned into waste.  Oh well.<br /><br />Some smaller points of comparison between Archtek and \\""Hygiene Preferred\\"":<br />-Archtek's seems to be harder.  I have pointed out that this makes my teeth hurt.  It is also possible that it will make the guard last longer, although for the sake of my poor teeth I'm not going to experiment with it long enough to find out.<br />-Archtek's has the tab in front.  Yes, this is convenient for holding it in the water, but I had no problem using a spoon in the past.  It is, however, very difficult to smooth once you've cut it--there's still a rough part on mine.  I will admit that this didn't bother me as much as I thought it would, though--I guess I had enough to be bothered about without that.<br />-Archtek's extends all the way to the back of my teeth.  I think that I have a bigger mouth thanaverage, so I could see it extending too far for some people.  They suggest cutting it if you have a smaller mouth, but I can't imagine that this would work any smoother than cutting their tab.  Hygiene's, on the other hand, misses a couple of my teeth on either side.  This is not a problem, though--you still can't grind those teeth against each other because of the gap.  I think that this is part of what made Hygiene's easier to mold to my teeth.<br />-Yes, Archtek's has a slightly fancier case with a mirror in it.  If you actually care about that, then I guess you'd better buy Archtek.  Ironically, their case is slightly too small for their over-sized guard (see above point) and would actually fit Hygiene's guard better.  Maybe, once my Hygience's guards come in, I'll at least use Archtek's case.<br /><br />In short, I only have one brand to compare it to, but Archtek comes short in almost every way.  Slightly cheaper, but horrible value--especially if you're like me and want to throw it away after your third use.",14596.0

Williams Lectric Shave with Electric Glide Formula being a very close second    This is a review of six products and this same review is posted on each product's Amazon site. The products tried were (in order of preference): Williams Lectric Shave, Electric Glide Formula (California North), Afta Pre-electric by Mennen (original), Skin Bracer, Eltron Prep and Kinexium Shave Oil by King-Of-Shaves.     I have used an electric shaver for more than 30 years and, for the first time in over 20 years, am trying these pre-electric lotions again after having shaved without these the last 20 years. In general, these all provide a noticeably smoother and less irritating shaving experience. They don't speed up the process, but do allow for a close shave while minimizing the shaver `burn' sensation that follows shaving. The trick is to find the one that you prefer based upon application, performance and odor.    Bottom line: Despite the superior application and lower `oily' feel of Afta, I had to go with Williams Lectric Shave. It is easy to wash off (if you wish) and has a mild and pleasant odor. Electric Glide Formula is a very close second and I alternate between the two, but use Williams Lectric Shave much more often. Williams Lectric Shave has the least amount of 'gumming' in the blades vs. the Electric Glide Formula (which can be heavy).    The gel consistency of Afta is much better for application than the liquids (which run through your fingers, like water), but only Afta is a gel. It's surprising: you'd think they would all be scrambling to offer the superior gel consistency or, at least, put the liquids it into a spray pump. If you put the Williams Lectric Shave and Electric Glide Formula into sample-sized spray pumps, spray them on your face then spread with your hand, you will have a much better and less wasteful experience.     Application (applying it to your face):     Using a spray pump for the water consistency products is a must. Without aspray pump, application is difficult and wastes product (as it runs off your hand)    - Afta has a gel consistency that makes application easy and can sting.  - Electric Glide Formula has a water consistency and no sting when applied.  - Williams Lectric Shave has a water consistency and can sting.  - Skin Bracer has a water consistency and can sting.  - Eltron Prep has a water consistency and can sting.  - Kinexium Shave Oil is like spraying WD-40 onto your face: VERY oily and is no longer a candidate.    Shaving:     They are ranked in order of preference. Most of the products cause `gumming' of the beard trimmings in the shaver blades. This will require more frequent cleaning of the shaver than shaving without them.    - Afta has less of an `oily' feel to it that is easy to wash off. There is no 'gumming' (clumping of the beard trimmings in the blades).  - Williams Lectric Shave has a moderate `oily' feel that is somewhat easy to wash off. There is very little 'gumming'.  - Electric Glide Formula has a moderate `oily' feel that is easy to wash off. Heavier 'gumming' vs. the above two.  - Skin Bracer has a moderate `oily' feel that is difficult to wash off and can cause `gumming'.  - Eltron Prep has a moderate `oily' feel that is difficult to wash off and can cause `gumming'.    Scent following sink washing of the face:    These will all stay with you for many hours, so you better like what you pick (ranked in order of preference).    - Williams Lectric Shave has an `evergreen' odor.  - Electric Glide Formula has a mild citrus odor  - Skin Bracer has a moderate lime odor  - Afta has a strong musty `woodsy' odor.  - Eltron Prep has a `skunk' type of odor",14593.0

I was quite surprised about the outcome and felt obligate to write this review to give fellow shoppers a balanced point of view.  Maybe the fellows giving the rave reviews have different needs for the device.  I bought mine for the relief of long trips (typically 6-hour drive or more).  Therefore, the \\""cigarette lighter\\"" adapter was a strong plus.  You may have similar needs if this is intended for a \\""long sitting down\\"" in the house or a dorm.  However, in this case, you have choices of better products (without the car adapter and a little more expensive).  Regardless of how cheap this thing is, it will be you thrown-away money, anyway!  Here are reasons why this is not a good product:  1. The \\""massaging\\"" components likely will not fit most people, especially if you have a large frame.  Those components don't look like they can be easily rearranged.  I have a small frame (cloth size S), and they are already out of places.  For a larger and taller person, the arrangement will be even worse.  2. The massaging elements are just vibrating (NOT knitting).  While this may be \\""just a minus\\"" to many of us, they can be \\""deal breakers\\"" in this case.  They are so noisy (especially when they are on MAX) that I find it is hard to sit around with this kind of distraction, even though I am very easy to be pleased!  If you've ever tried to work, study, read, ... while someone is vacuuming around you, this is a similar experience.  3. The padding of this device is poor.  This causes problem with the \\""thigh\\"" massaging components.  I can uncomfortably feel the two lumps under my thighs.  It likes someone putting something on my car seat!  If you turn those vibrating components on, there is some relief (but not much), and this leads to the next major problem.  4. The manufacturer instruction warns that the unit should not be used for more than 20 minutes.  Since it doesn't explain why, it's important to stick with this recommendation.  Therefore, for a long drive (or a long sitting down session), you have to constantly remember turning them on and off.  And while they are off, you are sitting on something quite uncomfortable!  It is also strongly recommended that one should pull to the side of the road each time to adjust or operate the device.  There are 5 controls total so I feel that it is equally important to follow this recommendation.    I didn't have a good feeling when I tried this out at home, but I decided to try it on a trip anyway.  That was a mistake!  I could not wait to pull into a rest-stop to remove the device.    If you are thinking about trying this out since you can always return it, then you should consider the shipping charge.  This product is sold by \\""target.com\\"".  The regular Targets in my area do not have it.  The charge is $7.5 for shipping handling.  That is 1/3 of the product price.  I've never returned anything bought from Amazon but I will on this one.  There is another $7.5 charge on the shipping for the return.  I am not sure how they calculate the refund but I will be out between $7.5 or $15 because I was mislead to buy a poor quality product.",14580.0

The instruction book has some blather about it not working if the basin has water in it-- BUT THAT IS WHERE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO PUT THE WATER. In other words, it will not work if you are using it to work as it is supposed to work. You are supposed to turn it off and unplug it for a half hour, and then plug it back in, and then turn it on. Then you have to wait yet another half hour, only to find out it still DOES NOT WORK. What sort of appliance is set up this way, that one has to unplug and replug and turn back on? Why can't they construct it so it turns on, when you turn on the switch, and reliably so. I will never buy another Sunbeam product again. Stay away from their humidifiers like the plague.",14564.0

Then at least two of the packs looked different than the others, although the brush heads look alike as I compared them one beside the other. Then after replacing one of my wife's brush heads with a new one from this shipment, the head broke apart after a couple of weeks even sending plastic debris into my wife's mouth. Very, very strange. Then it was my time for a replacement, and from time to time the little metal piece that can be seen in one side of the brush heads protrude from the plastic piece and slightly tickles my tongue, not sure what's going on. I though they were not original Oral-B replacement parts but then when comparing them to the older ones they look exactly the same, if they are fake these are very good fakes so I don't think they are<br /><br />In any case, they maybe very old brush heads without all the changes or improvements Oral-B had put into them over the years, or simple started to deteriorate after being stored for a long period of time. Not sure<br /><br />But one thing: I bought them for the best price ever. Maybe next time I have to make sure I check the type of package they come in or even when (or where?) they were made instead of just looking for prices, as it seems not all these brush heads are the same, even if they all are OEM Oral-B parts<br /><br />UPDATE: This past weekend the head I was using finally broke apart after less than two weeks of use and I almost swallowed the metal pin that came off.

If I made things tight enough to somewhat hold my foot in the position it should be in for a device like this, then my toes would start to tingle and foot fall asleep right away or there would bee a lot of pressure on my lower leg/ calf area.    Basically, if your foot flexes downward (away from the knee, which is what you're trying to prevent) then it just causes the velcro around the calf to slide down unless you make everything incredibly tight.    Like some others, I had to rip it off after not wearing it for very long in order for me to fall asleep (rather than just having my foot asleep, that is).    I think the concept of \\""pulling up\\"" on your foot from the top may just be flawed, as opposed to having something under your foot to \\""push up\\"" on it or hold it up.

I am a side sleeper and so I bought this to maintain my alignment while sleeping on my side.  The pillow, however, compressed more and never maintained its structural integrity such that my alignment then changed and I began having my 'old' pains once again.  I contacted the company, Therapeutica, several times with my concerns, with no answer.  Finally, several weeks later, I received an email back requesting my receipt, etc. with the receptionist, Wendy the General Office Manager, stating that she would have to check in with a supervisor to see if it would be possible to exchange the product.  3.5 weeks later, she informed me that I would have to send the pillow into their New York office so that they could test it on \\""their machine\\"" to determine whether the foam had broken down.

For the first 1.5 weeks, it was painful to sleep on, but I kept at it.  For the next 1.5 weeks, I loved it and I noticed a huge improvement in my posture.  What happened after that point was that the pillow noticeably 'broke down' and no longer supported my cervical and thoracic vertebrae in the same way (it got real squishy).  I am a side sleeper and so I bought this to maintain my alignment while sleeping on my side.  The pillow, however, compressed more and never maintained its structural integrity such that my alignment then changed and I began having my 'old' pains once again.  I contacted the company, Therapeutica, several times with my concerns, with no answer.  Finally, several weeks later, I received an email back requesting my receipt, etc. with the receptionist, Wendy the General Office Manager, stating that she would have to check in with a supervisor to see if it would be possible to exchange the product.  3.5 weeks later, she informed me that I would have to send the pillow into their New York office so that they could test it on \\""their machine\\"" to determine whether the foam had broken down.  Now, I agree that the product must be sent in to be inspected, however, the need for a machine to confirm my own experience with pain?  Not to mention the fact that one can physically FEEL the pillow on all its sides and SEE that the foam has obviously broken down in the area that juts up against one's shoulder.  (Yes, I followed their directions on how to sleep on the pillow to a T, in order to sleep on it correctly.)  I don't know about any of you, but this is THE MOST HASSLE and WORST COMMUNICATION I have ever had with a company and their product guarantee.  BUYER BEWARE!<br /><br />Sidenote: before purchasing this pillow, I had requested advice from the company re: the differences between the full sized pillow and the travel sized pillow.  Wendy, had informed me at that time that the travel sized pillow offered the same exact support as the full sized pillow and that for my needs, the travel sized pillow \\""was perfect\\"".  Once the pillow broke down, however, she changed her comments and stated that the company had not received many comments re: the travel pillow and that it was a TRAVEL pillow and not meant to be slept on every night.

NO Xplode uses some very dangerously high levels of some ingredients, and lots of ingredients that aren't even needed and may actually stop you from reaching your work out goals.    I used NO Xplode for almost a year, cycling it as suggested (3 months on, 1 month off).  From the first time I took it I could feel it doing what it stated it would.  At the gym I was very pumped up and found myself not getting tired like I would without it.  It helped me stay focused.    I have been working out religiously for the past year while on NO Xplode, going nearly every single day.  I eventually had to kick up the dosage to 3 scoops to get the same effect as 1 scoop did when I first started.  I know this is normal, so it didn't bother me.  But after a year, I felt like I was getting the results I expected.  I was gaining a lot of muscle mass of course, and saw the weight I could lift getting much higher.  But there was fat around my stomach that I just couldn't get rid of.  Not a lot, mind you, but enoguh so that my six pack was not visible, and there was still a little grab of fat on my sides.  That's when I started looking deeper into the supplements I was taking to try and figure out why.    What I found out shocked me.  Maltodextrin.  This has no use in this product except being used as filler.  In fact, this is the single product responsible for me not being able to lose my extra fat.  Look at the label, it is listed under \\""Other ingredients\\"".  It has NO use in this product.  It is used as filler and STORES FAT.    The amount of magnesium in this product is unbelieveable.  150mg per scoop.  That is 450mg if you use 3 scoops.  This is way higher than what a normal adult should intake in A DAY.  After taking NO Xplode for about 6 months, I found myself having to run to the bathroom every time I went to the gym, about 15 minutes after I got there.  The reason?  Magnesium is used by doctors to be a laxative.      Does this product work?  Yes.  Do I recommend it at all? No way.  The maltodextrin and magnesium in the product alone should be enough to keep people away.  It can be very dagerous.  This review along with the review stating his liver enzymes were through the roof from this product should hopefully be enough warning for people.  Oh, and their post workout product, Cellmass, is also packed full of maltodextrin.     So if you are working out like crazy and not getting the results you are expecting, it could be because of the supplements you are taking.  There are plenty of alternative supplements out there that do not contain dangerously high levels of ingredients like maltodextrin and magnesium.

Waste of money.,"I feel absolutely stupid for even trying these. I should have known they were a gimmick. Me and my husband have allergies to a lot of soaps, so I figured why not at least give them a try? After reading all of the wonderful reviews I figured they'd at least work on lightly soiled clothes. WRONG.  I'm convinced that most of the good reviews are either from people that don't mind their clothes smelling bad or trying to sell these things.    I used them with a small load of lightly soiled clothes. The clothes came out smelling WORSE than when they went in. They weren't any cleaner and the only way I can describe the smell is wet stinky dog. I've used all kinds of normal non-scented detergents, and while some of them didn't clean well I've never had any cause my clothes to smell really bad like these things did. I read on some other sites that you could use them to wash other stuff too. I broke a couple open and rubbed them on my hands under water just to see what they'd do. My hands did end up really soft afterward, but the smell was HORRIBLE (yet again, wet dog smell pretty much). I couldn't even get the smell off until I washed my hands a few times with soap.     Oh yeah, the ones I ordered were also supposed to come with a bag for the nuts; it didn't.    I must say, this is the weirdest least effective product I've ever ordered. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. I ended up throwing the whole bag away.",14510.0

Now I know that this sounds like a relatively small concern, but it is a great deal louder.  I was worried that my children in the next room were going to wake up, it was so loud.<br /><br />Issue #2: The toothbrush head does not fit correctly on the brush base.  One was too loose and slipped off, and the 2nd one was an extremely tight fit and would not come off when it was time to change the head, I had to use a pair of vice grips to remove the offending toothbrush head.<br /><br />Issue #3: As of right now I have gone through 2 heads in the 3 weeks that I have had the product.  For some reason something on the inside of the brush head gets disconnected after vigorous use and the head completely stops spinning... my toothbrush still works, the engine runs, but the bristles don't rotate... so I put on a new head... 1 week later, same problem.<br /><br />Avoid this product.

The company, Johnson&Johnson/LifeScan/OneTouch/Ultra2 kept repeating that 20% is acceptable. I disagree. I think meters reading 20% inaccurate should be replaced. I checked the meter with the lab results and it read 20% higher than the lab results. So quickness is not a good thing for me. I would prefer to wait one minute for an accurate reading rather than one that can be anywhere in a 40% range.    The company, LifeScan/OneTouch/Ultra2, is really Johnson & Johnson, quotes the FDA regulations of +/- 20%. Maybe change the regulations?    In this case, haste makes waste.    Also the meter uses 1 microliter of blood. The meters at Walmart, ReliOn use almost half, 0.6 microliters of blood. The test strips of the ReliOn are 1/2 the price of OneTouch. So I will buy a $9 ReliOn meter and check it against the LifeScan.    I might change my decisions if I had to test repeatedly. I was using the meter to check as I lowered my glucose readings with diet and exercise, not because I was diabetic. When the meter read 86 mg/dL, then the lab results were 72 mg/dL. This was the number I was aiming for, in the low 70's. If I used the Ultra2 and it read 72, then the real number might have been 60 which is too low. So I need accuracy for my purposes much more than I need speed.    I still cannot believe that the regulations allow +/- 20% for these meters. Am I alone in this dismay?",14458.0

It takes several attempts to get the initial connection and I have to re-connect constantly. Sometimes the mouse will work and the keyboard doesn't, but most times it is usally the mouse with the problem.The other annoying problem with this is  the occasional lag time from when you click on an item, it sometimes takes 3,4 or 5 seconds for the computer to acknowledge that you have done anything.

Also, was replacing another humidifier that required filters, and wanted to go filter-less...didn't mind using distilled water for this.     I'd read that this one emitted a plastic smell at first, but the reviewer stated that the smell went away in a day or so. Hence, I ran it in the living room first, to try to get rid of some of that smell before putting it in my 11 month-old-daughter's room. After a few hours, one of my eyes began burning! I thought it may have been a reaction to the humidifier, which did emit a plastic smell, but I could only smell it up close. So I wasn't sure. The next night, I put it in my baby's room, and within 10 minutes or so, my throat and sinus passages felt constricted and tight, could not breathe well, felt head-achy, my eyes were stinging (although not burning like the night before), and my daughter awoke, crying. I turned it off, and in less that 5 minutes, all my negative symptoms went away, and my baby was back asleep. I aired out the room (which we keep closed to keep the cats out) too. I feel like it was having to breathe in the plastic particles that had us strained, and that continuing to use this humidifier would have negative consequences on my daughter's health. We don't have any serious sensitivity to smells/allergies, or breathing problems, so I was surprised.    It is cute, and was extremely quiet (unlike our other humidifier), but needless to say, I was extremely disappointed, and will definitely be returning this ASAP. Will be ordering filters for the old one...never had those kinds of problems with that one (The First Years American Red Cross).

As a long-time Optelec user and repeat buyer, it is terrible to see a company go down the drain at the sake of their customers. Optelec used to stand behind their \\""lifetime warranty\\"" for the ClearView...no longer. Exactly four years into the lifespan of this purchase, the entire unit suddenly stopped working. No problem we thought since it has a lifetime warranty...the exact reason we purchased this unit rather than repair a much older unit (which didn't have a lifetime warranty).<br /><br />Two years ago this same unit also needed a repair which was promptly taken care of without cost. Unfortunately, now that yet another repair is needed (a major one it should be noted), Optelec claims they DO NOT offer a warranty on the Clearview model...in direct conflict to the claims made at the time of purchase four years ago.<br /><br />Worse yet, the rep initially claims not to have any information on the prior repairs until confronted with copies of the original paperwork...at which time they suddenly \\""find it\\"". Likewise, they also now claim to have provided a full lifetime warranty on the original \\""clearview\\"" model...until we mention having the old one which needs repair...oh-no...THAT specific model isn't covered.<br /><br />Bottom line - a good company has gone down the drain and will NOT honor the warranty on these units. I cannot recommend purchasing one of these in any situation due to the total failure of customer service to abide by their warranty. Expect a lot of \\""Run around\\"", missing paperwork, double-speak and lack of coverage for an expensive item.<br /><br />For those that are interested...here is a copy of the original Optelec Press Release dated Nov 15,2002 which specified the Lifetime Warranty as well as a definition of what constitutes an ClearView \\""system\\"" and \\""end user\\"".<br /><br />Clearview Video Magnifiers Now Carry a Lifetime Warranty<br />November 15, 2002<br /><br />Optelec, U.S. Inc. has announced that its ClearView video magnifiers now come with a lifetime warranty. The warranty applies to ClearView systems purchased as of October 1, 2002 and is available to original, individual end-users.<br /><br />\\""Our new lifetime warranty is the first of its kind in our industry,\\"" notes David Israel, President of Optelec, a member of the Tieman Group. \\""It is our way of telling customers that when they purchase a ClearView product through an eye care professional or an authorized Optelec dealer, they can depend on that product for quality, service and support.\\""<br /><br />For the purposes of the warranty, a ClearView \\""system\\"" includes the camera base unit, x-y table and in-line monitor or camera base unit with x-y table. The original end-user is defined as the individual who registers the unit for warranty purposes. The warranty is not transferable nor does it apply to units with multiple users, such as schools.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br />The decision to purchase a CCTV isn't easy and a lot depends upon the individual user as well as preferences. After evaluating several brands this was the clear winner. Here's why...<br /><br />1. Great customer support. Used the old model of the Clearview and this model. Company provides excellent support including sending a rep to your home if required.<br /><br />2. Versatile. The model shows a screen sold with the unit but the fact is, this can be plugged into a wide varity of screens and/or televisions. They must be newer and support the requirements so understand what you are doing - but suffice to say it's not only possible but quite easy. It took less than ten minutes. The benefit is lower cost and much less space on the desktop. With a simple switch you can toggle between computer, CCTV viewing and even the television.<br /><br />3. Many different settings to select from. This is one of the most important considerations both in terms of brightness, color, zoom and more.<br /><br />4. Easy to use and convenient access to all controls.No need to lift hands, results in natural feel while using product.<br /><br />As a daily user of this product for the past ten years, it's truly a huge benefit for those with low vision.or the past ten years, it's truly a huge benefit for those with low vision.",14421.0

When it arrived, the first thing I noticed was that the plastic it was wrapped in had been opened.  The brace itself is little more than a thick ace bandage with straps.  I thought 'I am returning this' before I even tried it on.  But then, thinking it might offer more support than it looked, I tried it on.  It didn't fit.  So, I look in the package for return info.  None.  I had to go to their website to find out how to return.  According to their site, you have to get an RMA and will most likely be socked with a restocking fee.  I felt this was unfair but I wasn't paying this much money for something I wasn't going to use.  Anyway, an extremely rude CS rep quickly informed me that of course, this type of item was non-returnable.  I honestly believe it had been returned before because of the condition of the packaging and told her so but she curtly told me again, no money back.  I find this horribly unfair.  IF such items are unreturnable, the buyer should be informed of this on the AMAZON website.  A buyer shouldn't be responsible for launching an investigation on return policies!!  I would NEVER order something that I couldn't return.  I understand hygiene issues to a certain extent but again, there should be a warning that you will NOT be able to return this item. As I explained to the seller, trying on a knee brace is like trying on a pair of shoes in a department store-one is no less hygeinic than the other. AND, did I mention it was OPEN when I received it?  How do I know that several people hadn't tried it on before me?  I feel quite duped.  I would never order from this seller again.  I notice that this brace is now being sold by a different seller so I wanted to make clear who I bought the brace from--it was from Medical Department Store.  As an update, when I left feedback, the seller left a scathing comment saying that they doubted that their Customer Service Rep was rude to me. So, I lost 70.00 and then got insulted when I dared to question their policies.  Again, very poor customer service.",14398.0

In my opinion, it is under-engineered, under-designed, inadequately manufactured, and overpriced.<br /><br />I am a product designer and have manufactured electronic and electromechanical products for over 20 years.  I have been a technical expert witness as a medical device designer, testifying in Federal Court.<br /><br />I went to a new dentist and was talked into paying $130 for this Rotadent wonder-brush.  I was using an Oral B electric toothbrush at the time and had no problems with the brush, but was told my teeth and gums were not in good shape.  (I am not so sure that wasn't part of the sales pitch.)<br /><br />Unlike the Sonic Care and Oral B products, the Rotadent has a slide switch, which is not sealed - the instructions suggest popping the switch cap off of the switch to clean around it.  This is not a waterproof, or water resistant, or sanitary switch.<br /><br />The Rodadent does not have any visual indication of either when the battery if fully charged or needs recharging - both the others I have used do.<br /><br />The Rotadent has a simple power supply that plugs into the wall and I do not know if there is a charging circuit or whether it merely trickle charges.  Both of the real products on the market monitor their charging.<br /><br />The Rotadent charger requires plugging into the bottom of the toothbrush.  Both real products use an inductive coupling, which allows the case to be sealed and waterproof.<br /><br />The Rotadent is not waterproof or water resistant - it is possible to blow air into the charging plug out the motor shaft.  I use my toothbrush in the shower - and this would not last 2 days in that environment.  Again, even the switch would not be able to withstand being used in the shower.  (Even the disposable Crest electric toothbrush has SEALED push button switches, rather than the cheap and improper slide switch with a cap.)<br /><br />When I used it, the Rotadent seemed to slow down and speed up as I brushed different areas, based on the pressure I was applying.  I think that the motor and the battery are probably under-rated and not up to the task.  I have not had this experience with any other electric toothbrush I have ever used.<br /><br />When I purchased it from a dentist office, they said to be sure to register it on line IMMEDIATELY - THE SAME DAY.  They knew of cases where the warranty had not been honored because it wasn't registered `right away'.<br /><br />When I opened the Rotadent package I was immediately aware of the name of the dentist office from which I purchased it printed on the handle.  Although this is probably a marketing gimmick and a way of being sure the brushes are not returned to the manufacturer, the printing job not is sub-standard quality (angel hairs of ink trailing off of the printing.)<br /><br />Within a week, I tried to return the Rotadent to the dentist office where I purchased it.  I was told they do not take returns and do not offer refunds.  I said that the product was not a quality product and they said they would do what they could.  It took about 2 weeks to resolve the matter with the dentist.  Apparently ZILA, the manufacturer, has no return policy.  I was given a credit at the dentist for the price of the brush, and given a new Rotadent as well.  - Why?  Because they had thrown my original one out!  To me this means that they are very inexpensive for the dentists' offices to purchase.<br /><br />Bottom line: Don't try to hustle a cheap product on a design engineer.  And if you're caught, refund the money and move on.",14386.0

First off the instructions are terribly written and the pictures are way too small to see where the bulb or pump goes. Secondly the pump tube is too short as is the bulb wire. Thirdly the 3 layers of petals are too flimsy for the stones and also the water runs right over the bottom petal outside of the base instead of into the base full of water so it goes onto the place I set it on. Lastly the pump is not powerful enough to push the water up all the way up the 3 layers of petals. I was lucky if it got up to the second petal layer the water. And the calming trickling water sound was non-existent since the fountain hardly worked any. They should junk this design and start all over again with a stronger one that is already assembled. All fountains for tabletop use should be already assembled in my opinion. This was just frustrating and stressful.

I thought the product looked interesting online but in researching it further, I thought it was very overpriced for what you were getting. I attempted to inquire of the company as to how heavy the resistance band was, and telephoned over a weekend where my call was automatically patched elsewhere to a person who identified himself as the owner. (He said the machine had forwarded the call to his home). As I thought that the product was very overpriced, I did not purchase it at that time. A few days later, I received a promotional e-mail from the owner advising of a 25% discount if I used a certain promotional code. I attempted to telephone and order the product during business hours but no one answered the telephone, and no one returned the messages on the answering machine. I ultimately wrote the person who had sent out the promotional e-mail that I was trying to purchase his product but was having difficulty doing so as no one returned the calls to take the order. I should have run quickly elsewhere at that point but regretably did not do so. My conversation with that person was then that there was not actually a 25% disoount but that since a dvd was being thrown in for \\""free\\"", the value was increased and then the price was artificially 25% less. And I was advised that notwithstanding the stated in the e-mail 25% promotional code, there was no discount on the other accompanying items to go with the pilatesstick. As I thought the \\""promotional\\"" e-mail was deliberately misleading, I was not going to purchase the product. Since the owner agreed to substitute a lighter resistance band at no additional cost, I agreed to the purchase of the stick along with the center door strap which the owner agreed to take off $5.00 from.  It was my impression that since the company wascooperating in providing the lighter resistance band, then I would pay for a product which I still thought was overpriced. I was told that 2 boxes would ship out the next day -- the resistance band would be sent directly from the supplier. The very next day I received an e-mail confirming my purchase, but advising that my credit card was to be charged more money than the bottom dollar shipped price that I had been told the day before. There was only mention of one package - not 2. I wrote back that there was an error in the confirmation as to the price, asked for a crediting back of the overcharge and inquired as to what about the 2nd box. My e-mail wss ignored. The next day, I got an e-mail stating that the single box had shipped and again confirming the wrong price.  I sent another e-mail about this but was again ignored. Approximately 8 days later, one box arrived without the main component - the resistance band. The center door strap was thrown in the box wrapped with a rubber band with no diagram or written instructions as to installation; there was also no picture on the web of how it got installed so I could try to figure it out. Once again, I attempted to telephone the company during business hours several times but no one anwered the telephone, and I left two messages on the answering machine that no one ever returned. As the telephone calls were ignored, I sent two e-mails to the company as to the missing main component and no instructions and requested a response but was ingored. The first e-mail advised that my credit card company had already told me to put the charge in dispute but I wrote that I was giving this company one final opportunity to rectfiy the problem and to respond. There was however still no response so I later sent a second 2-mail advising that the charge was now in dispute. There was no response of any kind until my credit card company intervened and put a stop payment to the charge and attempted to contact the company. At that point, the company finally responded with a tale of woe, and instead of providing the missing components and instructions, advised, and I quote from the e-mail, that \\""My wife got frustrated and refused to work on this and I have not been able to hire anyone because we do not have the cash for it\\"". Supposedly, a person was being hired. Several e-mails went back and forth as my credit card still had not been credited back. Instead of apologizing to me, I was told that they would apologize to my credit card company which I found to be incredulous. What about apologizing to the customer! Where was the customer service? If they could not even provide the product and instructions for the door installation, and never responded to the telephone or e-mails, who was going to provide customer service or honor the warranty if you needed same??    So how was the product? How did it work? I have no clue as they never sent me the main component or instructions, or offerred to do so. All I was told was that the company who made the center door strap had not/would not? do so, and that they would have to make their own instructions (which I still never got). On inspection of the partial product that I did receive, I stll think it is overpriced. The system consists of a a round stick/wood dowel with two rubber components at the end so that the screwed in straps (which the wood stick goes through) do not slide off. The ends have a thin rubber circle screwed in at the end   to cover the cut off wood ends. The stick is somewhat rough in the middle due to the fact that the words pilatesstick have been wood burned a good portion of the length of the stick which I assume would be annoying when/if holding the bar in the middle due to the roughness of the surface. There is a d ring attached to each of the loops which again are placed through the wood stick. The stick comes in a bag and it is my understanding that the missing resistance band was supposed to be the strap for the carrying case. As to why anyone would be carrying this around with them, I do not know. A mat was also provided as well a dvd,  a chart with diagrams for exercises and a door anchor.       I was originally going to purchase the \\""Tower to Go\\"" from Balanced Body, an established pilates vendor, but someone erred and told me the springs were shorter than they actually are so I began looking elsewhere where I inadventently found out about the pilates stick. Balanced Body has since corrected their website to add information as to the length of the springs (31 inches per spring). Of note, The \\""Tower to Go\\"" can be purchased either with 2 springs or slastix resistance bands.",14198.0

Turns out the towel method (the \\""free\\"" method) is infinitely better.  For starters, the foam pad does a horrible job at smoothing out the lotion.  It is WAY too smooth and the lack of a frictional surface causes you to have to apply an intense amount of pressure just to be able to rub the lotion.  Secondly, and by far the deal breaker in my eyes, the sides of the pads have a tough ridge.  When rubbing the lotion along your back you will likely at some point use it at the wrong angle which causes the ridges of the pad to stab areas of your back.  This is now only painful but also will leave your back covered in scratches.  The handle is sturdy but because it is slightly arched you can't get any pressure on the pad when applying the lotion.    Overall this is a horrible product and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone trying to find a tool to apply lotion to their back with.  You are much better off with the tried and true \\""towel method\\"".  Save yourself the pain, the frustration, and the money and avoid this product at all costs.",14197.0

But I purchased this specifically because it had a computer interface. The unit comes with only a serial port connector, which did not work on my laptop. Even after I purchased a serial to USB connector, the software asks if I am using Com1 or Com3 and either choice crashes the software. I've downloaded installation software from the website (thinking it might be more current) and that hasn't helped. The software manual (which is only available if you dig around the installation disk or on-line) also says nothing about how to make the device or software work with a USB port. So, it might be a great product if and when you get it working, but it is poorly documented and difficult to interface with common computer technology. Maybe the fact that all the installation files are dated 1997 is a tip-off that the software is outdated. If their technical support doesn't resolve the problem, I will have to send it back.

I was skeptical, but as we were looking for a product to help with our kid's allergies, decided to give it a try.  There was absolutely no difference in the quality of the air in their bedroom after a few weeks. The documentation does correctly state that the product does not work with allergens or dust that has settled on surfaces of the room, only for things floating in the air.    However, the convection current is not nearly strong enough to really pull enough air through the unit to do any good at all. If you slap the carpet right next to the unit and look at the dust that billows up, most of it will settle right back on the ground next to the Airfree - even right next to the air intake vents, you can not see even the slightest pull of the dust towards the unit - it just settles right back down on the ground.    The documentation also states that you need to keep it on for at least a week to notice any effect.  However, just the airflow from under any bedroom door will replace more air in the room in one day than this unit can clean in a month, guaranteed! And that's if you leave the door closed.    Think of it this way - you could get the exact same effect by leaving a burner on an electric stove turned on 24 hours a day.  Would you even consider this as a solution to your asthma? It's just a waste of electricity.    The unit is outrageously overpriced at $239.  I opened it up to see what was inside.  As expected, it's just a basic control circuit with a ceramic heating element.  As far as the parts go, there is less here than what is used to build a regular $25 coffee maker or toaster.

I looked at several face-down pillows for a possible solution.  Most are not suitable due to the following 2 problems:<br /><br />1) Not enough air flow so you can't breath<br />2) No forehead support<br /><br />My solution came in 2 steps, as follows:<br /><br />First - Buy the \\""Memory Face Cradle Pillow - Sherpa Covered Face Pillow by Core Products\\""  (sold here on Amazon.com for $46.99)<br />This is the type of pillow that massage therapists use on their tables.  The pillow supports your forehead and cheeks in very soft memory foam.  The chin area is open so it's comfortable for extended periods of time.<br /><br />Second - The height of this \\""Memory Face Cradle Pillow\\"" is 3\\"" so your mouth is very close to the mattress.  In order to increase the air flow around the pillow, you need to raise the pillow up off of the bed about 2\\"" by placing the pillow on a platform.  So to make a platform, I went to my local home improvement store and bought one 6' long board that was 2\\"" wide and 1\\"" thick. (cost $4.13)  I sawed the board into 3 pieces to form a U shape and then sawed four 2\\"" pieces for the legs of my platform.  I nailed these pieces together and the end result was a little wood platform to sit my \\""Memory Face Cradle\\"" pillow on top of.  Now, because the pillow is resting on top of this platform and not directly on the mattress, there is airflow all around the pillow.  Without this platform, the foam pillow will squash down as you sleep so your mouth will be right on the mattress.  The only way to ensure air flow is to build the wood platform and sit the pillow on top of this platform.",14149.0

However when a product claims \\""40\\"" uses, then notes it depends on so many variables, I would expect to get at least 4-5 uses our of a package of electrodes.  I get 2-3 uses per set of 4.    I have tried taking showers prior to usage allowing my body to completely dry. I have used Alcohol wipe prep pads to remove any oils from my skin  just prior to use assuring the skin is dry and clean. Yet, after the first use the edges start to lift up.  The 3rd use a pad or two will not stick securely enough.  When the pad does not adhere to the skin surface well you end up with the current arching slightly on the skin and this concentrates the charge in a small pinpoint location causing burning  and discomfort.    I even tried using the unit on my wife with a similar set of processes to ensure it was just not my body over producing skin oils or some other personal issue.  Usage on my wife achieved similar results.    A previous reviewer reviewed the dual channel (twin Stem TENS unit) and noted to \\""toss the included electrodes they are junk\\"" and purchase an alternate suppliers electrodes for the unit. A package of 4 of these electrodes are included with the unit.  Excellent advice, however since I can't find that review, I just asked my Physical Therapist which they used and ordered several pair. Much better.  So my recommendation is ask your PT which ones they use and order them instead.  They are \\""The cheapest pads around\\"" for a reason. Avoid unless you can afford to toss them out after one use.    ******* UPDATE *********    I have switched to the \\""EZ-STIK Reusable Electrodes\\"" and I have been on the same package of 4, used twice daily on Cervical spine and lumbar completing my third week this Sunday (two days from now.), and I suspect  it will be time to retire them and move on to a new package. But that is 42 applications which is far greater than I expected.    I am doing EMS, so my intensity levels are fairly high unlikewith TENS  where the current does not require such intensity often. (Roughly, TENS is often used to re-train nerve channel paths to carry a signal), where-as EMS is muscle stimulation.  My neck muscles around the Cervical spine tighten up as an over-reaction defensive action to protect the injury to the area).  The EZ-STIK electrodes cost more per unit, but if it lasts 4-5 times as long, I am saving money. I use the same procedures I used with the item you are viewing now. I hope this helps some people.

Let a professional do it if you must, TRUST ME.  It is very hard to get the little needle to go properly into the pore... you end up damaging skin on the surface of your skin and under it as well.  Also, the needle gets bent pretty easily.  My eyebrow area ended up looking pretty mangled up after my attempt-- there were small red craters in various places between and around my eyebrows.<br /><br />Oh, and the hairs grew back anyway because the settlings don't go high enough.<br /><br />The needle is too weak to work on the really dark hairs, like those on my underarms.  I killed a needle that way and I still couldn't not get the hair out easily.  I also tried it on a few light hairs on my forearm too, which was easier to work with since I have a clear view of my arm, but I honestly don't think that made a difference either long term.  Oh, and short term I left some small scars on my arm as well.<br /><br />This machine is not very expensive, so I thought I would give it a try, but honestly just save your money and save your cabinet space as well.",14078.0

Upon setting it up, I realized it was very poorly designed.  The unit allows for a handy swivel on the back projector tube to be able to project the time on the ceiling or wall.  The only problem is, the tube only swivels to the back of the unit, which has it's back up against a wall being placed on a bed-side end table.  The only way to get the unit to project on a wall you could actually see laying in your bed is to turn the unit around with the back facing out... how dumb is this?  Also... the switch to turn off the projector during the day is in the back.  This means every morning you must pick up the unit and turn it around to find the small switch.  They could have easily put a button on the front to do this.      Another major poor design on the unit is the design of the snooze button.  I rely heavily on the snooze button and usually press it 3 or 4 times before getting up.  (I'll normally set the alarm 30 minutes early for this reason)  Well... the snooze button on this unit is smaller than on normal units and is placed in the center of the bottom panel up against the tall panel that rises up.  The button is also surrounded by a semi-circle of all the setting buttons on the base of the unit.  It says in the manual that hitting ANY OTHER BUTTON than the snooze button will shut the alarm off completely.  Therefore... when half asleep when the first alarm sounds, one must carefully arch their fingers to press snooze, and be careful not to press the buttons in front of it or the sides!  Plus, the tall unit is so flimsy and light, if you miss the snooze to the back of the button, you will easily knock the unit over or sideways or something.  I've had this alarm for less than a week, and I've already been late 2 times.      Over all review:  Terrible design, I don't know how it was ever approved by a design team.  If you rely on snooze to get up, buy something else or be prepared to be late occasionally.",14076.0

The pain became worse as the weeks went by, and by 26 weeks, I almost couldn't walk normal anymore. After talking to my ob/gyn, she suggested I try a maternity support belt to relieve the pressure on my sciatic nerve. I read a number of reviews on Amazon, and finally decided to order two different belts, based on the good reviews each one received. While I was waiting for my belts to arrive from Amazon, I also went to Babies R Us and bought one there. Here are my reviews for each belt:    One of my choices from Amazon was the \\""Soft Form Maternity Support\\"" belt ($ 33.99). As soon as it arrived, I took it out of the package and was a little turned off. The belt's color is a really dark brown, which I wasn't too thrilled with. When I tried it on, I noticed how thick the material is, which adds bulk underneath clothing. First, I put on the abdominal support pad, which really cradles your belly. Felt kind of nice. Then, I attached the belt and the upper tummy strap. I didn't like either one of these. The belt is split lengthwise into two panels across the back, which makes adjustments a little annoying, and it was rolling (or folding) down on top. The Velcro taps on the belt are wider than the abdominal pad, leaving parts of the Velcro sticking out either on top, where it scratches your stomach, or on the bottom, where it scratches your legs. The tummy strap is thick and scratchy. No matter how I adjusted it, I couldn't get comfortable in this thing. I hope I can return it for a refund.  (Note: I just found out I CAN'T return this, so I wasted 34 bucks.)    My second choice from Amazon was the \\""Mother-to-be Maternity Support\\"" belt ($ 31.98). As soon as it arrived, I tried it on and loved it. The abdominal support pad is soft and comfortable. The belt is made from strong material and really hugs your back, which feels great and supportive. The belt doesn't roll down or fold over and really keeps it shape. The Velcro taps fit perfectly on the abdominal pad and are flat against the belly. Even though it is a strong belt, it also feels soft and stretches with your movements. The tummy strap is a little thick, but still feels comfortable. Initially, the top and bottom edge of the belt are a little scratchy, but I imagine I can get used to that. It's a minor price to pay to be pain free once again. The edges might still soften up a little, as the belt gets broken in with repeated wear and washings. Also, the belt hugs the body so well, it doesn't show underneath my maternity clothes. The only negative thing I can see with this belt is the fact that the back panel doesn't have the little breathe strips like other belts. This might cause extra sweating during the summer, but I would still take the sweat over the pain.     At Babies R Us, I bought the \\""Especially for Mom Maternity Support\\"" belt ($ 32.69). The nice thing about buying it at a store was that I was able to try it on before I bought it. Once I brought it home, I put it on right away. Everything about this belt is great. The materials are soft and comfortable. I'm wearing it on my bare skin for most of the day, and it doesn't irritate or scratch at all. It fits great, and the support is excellent for a soft, light-weight belt like this. The pain in my right hip and leg pretty much disappeared after wearing it for a short time. The belt has little breathe strips built in, so it is really easy to wear even in the summer. It keeps its shape without rolling or folding down.

(see 'long story', below).      However, now that I have it, I'll say it's a decent solar charger for rechargeable lithium batteries.  I only have the one, so I can't compare it to others; but it works as well as one could expect for a solar charger of this size.  It takes about 3 days of bright sun to get a nearly full charge.  If you're not afield, you can use the supplied wall-charger, which will charge 2 Lion batteries in 6 hours or so.    One warning:  Although it seems very water-resistant, if it gets rained on, it will leak through the charger port.  So you might want to tape that up if you're using the charger outside.  In other words, tape it up!    In partial sun, I measured 14V @ 60mA into a 0.56 ohm load, or about 840 milliwatts.  The box itself is about 3.5x9x17cm, but the active solar cell area is about 14x6cm.  Since the solar constant is about 1kW/m2, that puts the efficiency at about 10%, which is about right for mono-crystalline cells.      ===============================  The \\""Long Story\\"" (old)  ===============================  The below review was written several years ago, when 'ActiveForever' was still selling this solar charger, but showing a picture of a SteriPEN, instead.  So for many months, people (myself included) bought what they thought was a SteriPEN; only to find out later what they had REALLY being sold!     And though I tried for FOUR MONTHS to get Amazon.com or ActiveForever to fix the product image, the fraud continued!  I guess they didn't care, because the \\""error\\""(?) meant they sold a WHOLE BUNCH of \\""solar chargers\\"" to people who thought they were buying a Steripen.      But, finally Amazon, or ActiveForever, changed the fraudulent product illustration.  Yes, ActiveForever's sales of the \\""solar chargers\\"" have likely since dropped off, but they must be doing OK, since they're still  paying for an \\""Amazon.com sponsored link\\"".    And since the below 'review' is no longer relevant -- now that the fraud's been ended -- I was about to delete the whole thing.     But then I decided it might be good to keep around for a while, to serve as a reminder to myself and maybe as a warning to others to be careful.       ==================================  Original \\""Review\\"" (aka: warning!)  ==================================  I don't know how long this will stay posted, because Amazon.com seems to delete this review as fast as I post it.   And they delete the picture of the actual product that's for sale here, nearly as soon as I've uploaded it.  This is my second try to warn people.     So if you can read this, you probably just saved yourself $59.  But you'd better read fast!     In 25 words or less, the SteriPEN Adventurer is a very good product.  But the item for sale here has nothing to do with a SteriPEN.  This is actually a listing for a Solar Battery Charger for the SteriPEN!     So, read the full product title -- all the way to the end.  Pay particular notice of the last two words -- \\""Solar Charger\\"" -- because that's all your going to hear about a \\""solar charger\\"", until you open your order from Active Forever, and see what your $59 actually bought you.     And if you end up, as I did, as a proud owner of a solar charger for the SteriPEN, rather than the owner of an actual SteriPEN,  take comfort in knowing you aren't the only one, and now have a really nice solar battery charger.        However, I'm fairly certain this charger won't keep you safe from Giardia, or any other water-borne parasite, unless you are really agile and can manage to squish the little buggers with it.

Later, under the Noxzema trademark and similar packaging, Procter & Gamble distributed a similar product that lacked the original active ingredients but for the most part was true to the remainder of the original formula. Proctor & Gamble revised the Noxell label a bit, including removing the \\""medicated\\"" claim and adding the banner, \\""Thick Rich Lather,\\"" and the claim, \\""Dermatologist Tested.\\"" It continued to be a pretty good product.    After that, the quality of the product went steeply downhill, where it remains today. The product is now made in Canada and \\""Distributed by: UNIVERSAL GROUP . . . under license from The Proctor & Gamble Company and related companies.\\"" The order of the ingredients has been revised so that sorbitol, which was seventh in Noxell's list of inactive ingredients, is now the fourth ingredient, after water, stearic acid, and isobutane. Some ingredients have been moved further down the list, and thus are present in lesser quantity, likely for the purpose of reducing production costs. The net result is a product with nowhere near its previous quality. Spreading it evenly on one's skin takes an undue amount of time and effort, and the results are less than satisfying. The label still claims, \\""Thick Rich Lather,\\"" but the product lacks the consistency of its former incarnation. The claim, \\""Dermatologist Tested,\\"" is irrelevant without the test results, which could have been positive or negative.    You likely can find a better product.    Note to Product Manufacturers: Consumers are not stupid, we know about inflation. Please stop lowering the quality of your products to hold a price point or enhance your profits.

While I was packing for a trip recently, I placed these on a very expensive wood dresser.  Upon our return 6 days later, I picked them up off the dresser and was astonished to see a perfect imprint of the whole traction device in the dresser.  Nothing was set on top of them, they were not in direct sunlight, they were simply laying on the dresser.  Somehow, the rubber had a reaction with the finish on the dresser and the stain/imprint is now permanent!    I immediately contacted the company and sent them some photos of the damage.  Much to my amazement, here's their response:    I have been forwarded an email with explanation from our sales department.  While I understand that your wife may be upset over the dresser, Sure Foot Corporation cannot assist you or pay you money (if that is your reason for calling) for placing Get A Grips on the dresser and leaving them there for a period of days.   The intended use of the Get A Grip is that it be placed on the a shoe, after determining the type of Get A Grip which should be placed on the particular shoe and making sure sizing is correct) and that it be used as an aid in traction in walking on flat surfaces which may have less than optimal conditions due to ice.     I would suggest that you contact a woodworking/carpenter type of specialist and see what suggestions they may have for assistance.  Therefore to be clear, your claim is denied.  Any further comments or questions should be directed to me directly and no one else in the company.     Shirley Dvorak    General Counsel    Sure Foot Corporation          After getting this lame response to the problem with their product, I responded with:    Dear Shirley,     Needless to say, I'm disappointed with your response.  Rest assured, I will be returning both pairs for a full refund.  I will also be telling every person that has bought one of your products about this incident and your response.       There was absolutely no disclaimer on the packaging that by placing the item on a wood surface, it may be damaged by your product.  Your justification for not following through with my claim is a joke.  Are you suggesting that once a person buys this product, they are to immediately place them on their shoes and never take them off?  In reality, I'd guess that 100% of the people that buy this product need to take them off their shoes at some point and place them some where.  It's too bad that there are getting to be so many companies out there like yours that don't \\""fess up\\"" to problems when they are brought to their attention as in this case.  It's sadly poor customer service.  I will simply spend my money with companies that stand behind their products and who also \\""follow up\\"" when problems are brought to their attention.     Good luck to your company in the future as you'll never get a penny from me for any of your products from this day forward.          So, to anyone considering this product, BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

JUST DON'T DO IT.     Regardless of product claims, there simply is no way to remove scratches from prescription lenses without the risk of changing the prescription or causing distortions. Non-prescription lenses may be fixed with store-bought solutions, but a prescription lens is meticulously manufactured for visual clarity. Brushing liquid onto the surface of such a lens WILL RUIN THE RX. Even if you don't notice, your eyes will. You'll end up with eye strain, and have to replace the lenses anyway.     My advice to you is to either learn to live with the fine scratches or replace your lenses. Usually, very fine scratches on a lens do not affect the prescription and are not noticeable when you are wearing your glasses. If the scratches are deep, REPLACE THE LENS. There is no \\""shortcut\\"" - just more ways to waste your time and money.    The best way to prevent scratches in the future is to always clean your lenses with a solution specifically designed for the type of lens material they are made of, and always with a soft, lint-free cloth- NOT a paper product. Paper towels and tissues can leave fine lines. The wrong kind of lens cleaning solution can damage the coating on the surface of your lens.    The best lens material out there today is called Trivex. The next time you see your optician, ask about this lens. It is the most durable material currently on the market.",13943.0

When I contacted customer service via phone, after I placed my order, I got the run-around and was referred to \\""live chat\\"" which they eventually claimed wasn't working properly.  I haven't tried to use it again to verify if it works any differently than the day I tried using it.  The merchant clearly did not understand my frustration with trying to get customer service.  In frustration I bombarded every email address on their web site stating my displeasure and I did get the attention of the merchant.  I did get status email from the merchant, the last one stating the guard would be mailed out and I would get a tracking number.  That didn't happen.  The getting the tracking number part.  The guard was mailed out.  I received it a week and a day after the last email from the merchant.      The guard is a little less bulky than boil-n-bite OTC guards and not nearly as nice as the guard my dentist made for me. The guard invokes my gag reflex and interferes with my tongue.  Maybe if I trimmed it...but that kind of defeats the purpose of spending all that money for a custom guard.      My recommendation:  If you are in need of a night guard, either spend the extra money to get one from your dentist or stick with the OTC boil and bite guards, some which are only slightly bulkier than the one you would get from this merchant.  My dentist made me a guard in less than a week!    If you decide to order one here is what to expect:  You will get the impression kit.  I got mine 4 mailing days after I ordered.  I took the impression that night and dropped it off at the Post Office the next morning.  The merchant claims it took 10 days for them to receive the impression and then they claim they \\""rushed\\"" my guard, which means it was made and shipped the next day.  (The postmark doesn't quite agree with what the merchant told me.)  My guard was USPS Priority mailed to me.  From what I understand, the use of USPS Priority mail is atypical.  If I wouldn't have become a problem customer, I would probably be waiting another week to receive my guard.  In any case, for me, a problem customer, it took a whole month from placing my order to receiving my guard.  To give you some perspective on shipping times, I live in MA and the lab is in GA.  If you live further away from the lab than I do, expect the shipping times to be longer.    I wonder how hectic the refund process is going to be.

Worse than that, the screw-type bolt holes on the bottom were not machined correctly at the factory in China.  These bolts are necessary because they affix the support feet to the machine.  The bolts that came with my machine were too large for the holes, which proved to be irrelevant because the angle that the holes in the machine were drilled and then tapped is not level, so you can never actually screw the bolts in straight.  The bolts are actually screws with a Phillips head, so it's far too easy to strip the screws; however, maybe on properly-machined bolt holes the screws go in easier.  As a final testament to the level of quality associated with this product, the instruction manual is rife with inconsistencies, typos, and classic Engrish.

The manual makes no mention of this condition specifically, but does advise re-seating the maintenance free box and trying again.  No dice.  With quality control of this caliber, letting a relatively simply device like this slip out in a completely non functioning condition, I'm not going to give them a second chance or any benefit of the doubt.  I'll be interested to see some reviews of this unit from other who might get a functioning unit.<br /><br />Also  the marketing claim that this is the \\""First ever maintenance free humidifier\\"" is patently false.  You need to purchase a \\""maintenance free box\\"" after every 1 000 hours of operation at around $30.00 a piece. Twenty four by seven operation  during the cold months when my forced air furnace is operating  means you get about six weeks before shelling out another thirty bucks.

Within 20 seconds there was a stream of cool mist flowing into my family room, confirming that my first unit was indeed DOA.  The 2 gallon tank lasts around 20 to 24 hours.  The top of the unit and the side in which the mist is flowing will always get soaked with water.  You will find yourself frequently wiping it down of standing water.  No matter how careful I tried it was impossible to remove the tank for filling or replace the tank after filling without getting water everywhere and creating a mess to clean up.  I was willing to put up with all of the little annoyances that this humidifier had to offer because it really does make my family room much more comfortable to be in.  However, after about five days of using this humidifier I noticed a white film on my television.  Then I noticed that the white film was on everything.  It took forever to clean up and quite honestly I don't think I'll ever be able to fully remove the dust and film that was deposited everywhere.

He suffers from congestive heart failure and frequently needs supplemental oxygen. The idea was that a finger pulse oximeter would help me to determine when my father needs additional oxygen.     I chose this particular model mostly because it is reasonably priced and supposedly reliable. But apparently I made a mistake. The device works sometimes, but mostly it does not. The first one I received would provide my own (healthy) oxygen levels most of the time but was vexingly fussy whenever I attempted to get readings from my father. You need to have the patient's finger inserted into the device juuuust so or else it doesn't work, and even when the finger appears to be perfectly placed the 5500 still frequntly fails to operate.    After a few weeks the device stopped working altogether.  I sent it back to SPO and requested a replacement. SPO obliged me. But whatadaya know, the replacement unit was just as balky and difficult to use as the original.     If one is willing to work for say, ten minutes at getting a single oxygen saturation level reading, this device eventually will get the job done. But basically, it's a fussy, poorly designed piece of equipment that is disappointingly unreliable.

They advertised a special of a new chair that was returned for a discount and they sent me an old used refurbished chair with high mileage, while claiming it was better than new. This chair was damaged and had exposed wiring and the leg massage did not work. How would you like it if you bought a car and the odometer was turned back?     When I protested, they refused to exchange it. They then claimed the chair was smoke damaged and if I did not take back the chair I would be charged $711.00 to replace the upholstery. This is probably more than the company paid wholesale for this item.     This company is not the manufacturer. They import these chairs from China. They are cheap and they make a high profit on them. They do not have a factory service facility. An article on their website states they have only 5 employees. They chair they sent me had a repair tag on it. There was no company name plate, model number or serial number. This is not a quality item. It is a metal frame covered with PVC plastic material and it is not even comfortable as a regular chair. So when it breaks, it is totally useless.     There 5-year warranty is to their discretion. They only provide One Year of full coverage. After that, the purchaser must pay the shipping charge both ways that can cost 5 to 6 hundred dollars. There 30 day free trial is the same. If you decided not to buy the chair the original shipping charge is subtracted from you refund and you have to pay the return shipment. So it is not exactly free is it? You just paid over $500 for a free trial.    Company policy as copied from the website:    Return and Cancellation Policy: Customer has 30 days from the time the chair is received to return for a full refund of the purchase price less the original delivery and return shipping and handling costs for Premier Health Products chairs.     You may pay handling costs too. They don't explain that.     Returned massage chairs must be received in \\""like new\\"" condition in the original packaging and materials, including manual, or the customer will be charged a restocking fee of 10% in addition to the cost of replacing the missing items. Financing customers are also responsible for finance processing fees on returned chairs. Massage chairs not in the original box cannot be returned. All returns must be accompanied by a Return Authorization Code or they will be refused by our receiving department.   Please call to obtain a Return Authorization Code and return shipping call tag. Customers that cancel or refuse delivery of shipped merchandise will be charged for all shipping costs and assessed a 10% restocking fee. Customer must have the chair in transit back to manufacturer on or before the 30th day. Any special services such as finance processing fees, date certain shipping, inside delivery, lift gate, white glove delivery, or unpacking of merchandise is non refundable. Orders that are cancelled prior to shipping will be assessed a six percent restocking fee to cover credit card charges incurred by our company in good faith.   It is the customer's responsibility to thoroughly inspect the chair for any freight damage or manufacturer defects and report to Premier Health Products within 3 days. Chairs damaged in shipping will be exchanged for another new chair at no cost to the customer. Do not discard boxes for 30 days, until you have assembled, inspected and tested the massage chair.    This company has left a lot of openings not to refund your money and that is exactly what they did to me.     I am an unhappy customer of Premier Massage Chair Company. In I bought one of their specials at a discount price. They claimed it was a return by a customer. When it arrived, the boxes were all beat up and the chair inside was damaged. It was not packed correctly. It banged around inside the box. It looked like they took spare parts from the warehouse and created a chair for me. One of the motors was bad too. Eric Henderson blamed it on FedEx and said it was in perfect condition when they shipped it.     [...]    Do yourself a favor and do not buy this chair sight unseen. You will be sorry. Read the small print in their Purchase Agreement and then buy your chair from a reputable company.  Mark Vornsand    MarkVornsand@Aol.com",13774.0

Are you suffering from some serious neck pain?  Are you getting migraines that hurt so badly, you don't know if you can stand another one?  If you're like me, you're desperately looking for a solution to cope with this painful situation that's stealing your life from you.  Yet, if you buy one of these -- if you believe the hype -- Doctor Riter has just taken advantage of another suffering soul who simply looks for a solution.     Here are the main problems -- It's incredibly cheap, poorly constructed, non-adjustable, unbalanced, flimsy & absurdly expensive.  If it worked, it would be worth its weight in gold.  But it is junk!  If you are wondering \\""WHY IS IT SOLD EVERY WHERE IF IT DOESN'T WORK?\\""  I believe people WANT TO BELIEVE that it will solve their neck problems & so they put their faith/hope into believing in the gimmick.  This really is a cheapo product marked way, way, way up - so if lots of people can make a buck, regardless of whether it works or not, they will sell it to folks like you and me!  After spending this amount of money for trash, you'll want to boast that you made a wise decision to reduce your cognitive dissonance.  Yet, the truth is THIS DOESN'T HELP & WILL END UP AT GOODWILL the next time they come a knockin'!  (I'll bet you can find one that's been discarded there.)     If you are seriously suffering from cervical pain, tightness in the neck muscles which lead up to the base of your brain -- this will only FRUSTRATE you with its inadequacy.  Also, most disturbingly, the white, curved plastic -- which is designed to support your neck & relax the shoulders -- hits exactly on one of my vertebrae, which makes using this device even MORE pain inducing.  If you glide the device up, it misses the vital neck muscles directly behind the ears & descending down the nape. It's ergonomically off, plain & simple.      I recently saw something called a PRON PILLOW, which will be the next \\""gamble\\"" that I take down this Yellow Brook Road towards wellness.

Consider this a warning.     First of all, the magnifying lens is useless.  If you were tweezing your brows, you would have to hold it almost vertically just to see thru the lens.  I dont know about everyone else, but I hold mine at slightly more than a 90 degree angle.  The people who made this must have forgotten that your eyes are under your brow not over it and a mirror would not help with this very much.  And if using the lense, you would have to pull the hair straight down instead of in the direction of the hair growth like youre suppose to.  So basically the lens is nothing but a piece of plastic that just gets in the way.  Attempting to actually make use of it, will only make tweezing more complicated.  And it really isnt.     And the light is a sharp blue LED which is almost too bright.  Honestly I dont see the point.  Maybe if it was just a regular light (not blue) it would soften the glow a little bit, making the hair easier to see.  I just turned it off.      I tried to use it as a regular pair of tweezers, and the palm of my hand started to get sore.  The Luma Tweeze is made slightly wider because of the lense and the light in the middle.  It is actually too bulky to even use as a regular pair of tweezers.     I figured this thing would be too good to be true.  I love cool gadgets.  Too bad this was not one of them.  So instead of ordering it online and paying for shipping, then again for shipping if I had to return it, I went Beyond.  I mean Bed Bath and Beyond.  They had it for $6.99.  Not too much of an investment for something that doesnt work.  But I prefer to get my money back and buy me a nice pair of plain tweezers that I can actually use.      To LumaTweeze......

April 6, 2009  The Book Butler is a poorly designed, cheaply manufactured that doesn't do the job that it was intended to do. In order for it to work on paperback books; at some point you have to fold the book backwards, breaking the back of the book for the Book Butler to be of any use. Then you have to repeat this procedure every 5 to 10 pages, effectively destroying the binding of the book. Even then the tops of the books bend inward as if trying to close itself. Even the books know that perhaps the inventor didn't actually test it on real books. The workmanship is slipshod and parts broke off easily, not intentionally on my part. I am writing this review to warn folks to save your money and try another book holder. I have a lot of spare time now that I'm retired and will pay more attention to detail when I write a review.

I tested after 3 min, & was planning on leaving it on a little longer. After 2 more minutes, my skin was on fire!! I couldn't get it off fast enough. It was hard not to rub, as my skin was itching so bad, but I didn't want to irritate it anymore. My skin was so red & splotchy, & I even had a few bumps (not too many, though)... it looked horrible.

Braun Oral B has serious quality issues.,"I had been pleased with my Braun/Oral-B power toothbrush for several years when eventually the batteries died and it was time for a replacement.  The only drawback I found was the high cost of replacement brush heads at all the local drug stores.  Since the toothbrush worked so well and the brush heads regularly lasted over 2 months, I just sucked it up and bought a new Oral-B power toothbrush and dealt with the high cost of replacement heads.   <br /> <br />I was pleasantly surprised when I finally found a source for brush heads at a decent price through Amazon.com.  I ordered 3 of the 4-packs (12 heads in total) and unfortunately every single brush head from that order was defective!  Each one broke within a few days--some of them didn't even work at all, right out of the box.  Apparently something inside the head would break and the head would cease to oscillate, leaving me with an expensive \\""regular\\"" toothbrush.  I have been using Oral B power toothbrushes for over 6 years and I never had this problem before.  I had one head left from a previous drug store purchase, and that one works just fine, so I know the problem is isolated to these defective replacement heads.   <br /> <br />I have had no luck in getting a refund or exchange through Amazon.com or the seller (YoungZebra), and Braun/Oral-B has told me that any refunds or exchanges must go through the retailer, and not through Braun directly.  Was this a fluke order of defective brush heads?  An isolated incident?  Perhaps, but since neither the retailer nor the manufacturer will take responsibility, I am wary about purchasing from YoungZebra or other \\""unknown\\"" stores through Amazon.com.   <br /> <br />P.S. - I eventually bought more brush heads at the higher drug store price, and those heads worked fine and were not defective.  However, now my power toothbrush has developed the dreaded power switch failure!  Sometimes I cannot turn it off when I am finished brushing, and other times it turns itself on randomly in the middle of the night.  Thumbs down to Braun/Oral-B!",13509.0

There are a number of things I didn't like about it right off the bat: <br /> <br />1. The part which presses the pill down on to the grinder gets its power from your hand squeezing the handle, but the pill-presser is on the opposite end as the hinge, so it's hard to get enough pressure to press the poll into the grinder.  If you don't press the pill into the grinder with enough force, the grinding burrs simply slide over the surface of the pill without grinding it up. <br /> <br />2. The unit does not handle hard pills well.  It leaves relatively large chunks rather than powder, so you have to run the chunks through again. <br /> <br />3. The powder from the pill tends to stick to the grinder, so you have to scrape it off, otherwise you're leaving much of the pill in the pillverizer. <br /> <br />4. It has a splitter to split harder pills so they will grind a bit more easily, but it's very difficult to use with pills that aren't circular (such as the oblong \\""caplet\\"" type.)  <br /> <br />5. After grinding only one pill, powder from the pill got in between the grinding wheel and the stationary part beside it, creating friction and making the crank harder to turn. <br /> <br />It's difficult to use, takes a lot more time to grind a pill than it should, it's poorly designed and doesn't work well.

I purchase sinus medication every now and then and I'm always looking for a new product to try. I was skeptical about these tablets because I couldn't see how menthol, eucalyptus, and camphor vapors would make much difference in battling sinus problems. But the only way to know for sure was to buy a package and try them out.<br /><br />Upon placing one of these on the shower floor, I started the water and waited for the big moment when my sinuses would start to feel clearer and I could breathe more freely. But no such moment ever came. The aroma from the combination of menthol, eucalyptus, and camphor vapors is pleasant and it certainly has a medicinal, herbal aura about it. But aside from the pleasant smell, there is nothing special about these tablets. They did absolutely nothing to make my sinuses feel clearer. The medicinal scent leads you to believe something good might happen, but nothing ever does. And when it comes to sinus problems, psychological advantages really don't mean much.<br /><br />As the water flowed and I breathed in the vapors, I wondered if I had done something wrong. I even pulled out the box and read the instructions one more time. But no, I did exactly what I was told to do. I then looked up Shower Soothers in a consumer review site (something I should have done before I made the purchase) and I noticed that other people had similar complaints: The tablets might smell nice and the concept might be a good one, but they fail at their intended purpose. They do nothing to eliminate sinus problems. The scent is too weak and there is nothing medicinal that can break down sinus congestion.<br /><br />Each Shower Soother tablet lasts for one shower and possibly even a second. As the water runs, you will notice a steady stream of green colored liquid running from the tablet to your drain. The tablet dissolves away slowly in this manner, continuing to shrink in size until it is completely gone. If you're the type who takes quick showers, this tablet will be good for another use because it stops dissolving as soon as the water stops flowing.<br /><br />Shower Soothers are activated by water so they must be stored in a dry place. Each small box contains only a few tablets with a high, per- unit price. I assumed that the high price meant high quality and I incorrectly predicted that these tablets just might work.<br /><br />Overall, Shower Soothers are a useless product masquerading as medicine. If pleasant aromas are what you crave, light a scented candle and allow it to burn in the bathroom while you take your morning shower. The scent will be much better and you will save a good deal of money.y slowly in this manner, continuing to shrink in size until it is completely gone.

Of course, to find out about this Seiko shaver first hand you'll need to open the shrink wrap which then in turns makes it almost moot to return the item, because Donner charges a 35% sanitary disposal fee if you open the item. On top of that the shipping charges are also non-refundable. On the other hand, if I return the $8 grocery store shaver to the store, I'd get a full refund, if I'm not happy with the product. Ok, so how well does it shave? Not bad, but also not any better than the $8 shaver from my grocery store.

Thinking that an open tube didn't accurately simulate the human ear canal, I bent off the tubing thereby sealing it.  Once the candle had burned down I cut it open.  Sure enough, the contents of the candle with tubing at the end was identical to the candle I had held to my ear; there was an ashy powder along with tough, brown chunks of wax.  Since the contents of the candle without an ear attached to it matched the contents of the candle placed into an actual ear I can only conclude that the \\""ear wax\\"" found in the cut-open candle does not come from your ear.

I used to own a Norelco, 3 rotary shaver about 5+ years ago and gave it up because it would take so long to shave.  That and replacement blades/parts made it more expensive than buying a regular blade + shaving cream.  It also would leave my face irritated. <br /> <br />So I bought this based on the reviews plus the fact that it's a wet shaver.  I figured I could shave with the cream on, in the shower with an anti-fog mirror, and my face wouldn't be as irritated.  I would also save on time.  Not much difference. <br /> <br />First, it takes longer for me to shave with this compared to using a Mach 3 blade and shaving cream. <br /> <br />Second, it takes forever to shave under my chin with this... having to go over the hairs too many times I can't count... adding to irritation. <br /> <br />Third, using it in the shower with shaving cream doesn't work.  I come out of the shower and look in the mirror, and there are so many stray hairs that it slips and misses when shaving wet... it only prolongs shaving even longer.  It seems when you shave wet/with cream it just doesn't pick up the hairs as opposed to dry. <br /> <br />Now before you insist I haven't tried it out long enough, I am still using the shaver to this day for the past 3 months.  I used it non stop and the \\""your face needs to adjust\\"" slogan means nothing.  I have tried multiple times in the shower with the same result. <br /> <br />This just isn't worth it.

Unfortunately all those sites that sell scooters don't tell the truth and don't post honest opinions of users, I know that because I sent in a negative review on this scooter to one of the major scooter suppliers and they did not post it.  <br />Putting this scooter together is nothing short of a nightmare even when someone else does it for you. The pieces have to be put down and once down, the fun begins.  <br />1. It is a struggle to align and put the front and rear pieces together.  <br />2. Putting the locking pin is major nightmare, it just doesn't want to go in and you need a lot of strength to push it in.  <br />3. Once that is done then you have to connect three battery electrical cables.  <br /> <br />Together with the battery cover, seat and tiller it is a 12 step process!  <br />the reverse process goes for disassembly with an added touch. Taking the plastic battery cover is very difficult, you need a screw driver or a key to separate it.  <br /> <br />FINAL NOTE: it comes with one odd key that nobody can duplicate, it has a hole for key chain but the first time I wanted to put on a keychain it broke.  <br />I cannot use this scooter alone, when I use it someone puts it together and takes it apart for me.  <br />It performs okay on level roads and slopes but not so good on gravel, lose soil or grass. Sometimes it gets stuck on grass. Sometimes it just doesn't want to work. I definitely do NOT recommend this scooter. Don't waste your money on it.",13024.0

It seemed to have shaved more closely and quickly than the Braun and Panasonic shavers I had owned over the past 7 years (I travel alot and end up losing them eventually!) <br /> <br />However here's some very annoying things I found out after 2 months of using this shaver: <br />1.  It takes a couple of seconds or three to get the shaver on it's base properly.   It's not so intuitive.  The shaver is positioned in an angle and the base is shallow which makes it a little more difficult task than it should be. <br />2.  The trimmer attachment is a huge chore to attach especially if you're running out the door.  You must turn off the razor, gently pry the razor heads off, gently attach the trimmer, and then complete your morning shave.  I wish for my old Braun which had a flip up trimmer.  Bam!  It's done! <br />3.  The little rubber green piece where the cream comes out has come off and I can't get it to go back the way it was. <br /> <br />Overall, this shaver actually performed a great shave.  But it is too much of a delicate design for my taste.  If you can imagine yourself in the context of when this is used:  early morning, you're grumpy, you're in a hurry, and you're stressed about something at work, you don't want this as the shaver that you use everyday!   <br /> <br />Good luck in your search.",13015.0

The so-called massaging fingers are impressive at first. The biggest problem with this entire item, however, is when the fingers stop.

It feels like there are 4 Nintendo rumble packs tucked into this chair, two in the lower back area, two in the seat. Do they do much besides shake and make noise? No. Anything at all for tired shoulders? No. A friend and I also discovered that the lower back Shiatsu/rumble combo is too low for a 6' person, but too high for a 5' person.

She is holding the steamer several inches from her face and the steam is a thick mist that comes out of the steamer and reaches the area from her nose to the bottom of her chin.  When I used the steamer, a small trickle of steam drifted upward (not outward).  There is no way to increase the steam pressure so that the steam can be directed (blown) onto my face.  I had to hold the steamer under my chin and try to get the tiny trickle of upward-drifting steam to hit parts of my face.  This didn't work and I eventually gave up.  3)  The microdermabrasion unit is supposed to be used next and it actually works well.  This is one area where I found the instructions to be vague.  Am I supposed to use the various attachments with some sort of cleanser or am I supposed to use them dry?  Since my face was still completely dry from the steamer not working properly, I just got one of the microdermabrasion attachments wet with water and I used it that way.  It was kind of rough on my skin, so maybe I'm supposed to be using some sort of cleanser with it??  4)  I couldn't get the facial mister to work at all.  I made sure that the batteries were inserted properly, but the unit would still not spray out any water.   <br /> <br />I bought this piece of junk for $35 and I would like to return it to the store where it was purchased, but since it is a \\""personal hygene\\"" product, I think I'm stuck with it.

The blue paint finish is not uniform and the LCD cover's finish is dull. In short it looked either used or badly made. Considering Amazon's reputation, I wouldn't think it was used as the base of the unit was fine.   So my conclusion is that Lumiscope has no proper Quality Assurance checks.

This was both for the fat measuring and the weight. <br /> <br />The weight only measures in .5 pound increments, and the fat metrics require you to enter your height and sex and whether you are an adult or child.  I do not expect perfect accuracy for fat measurement since it is very hard to measure, but obviously if this info is being used the fat measuring is completely worthless.  For anyone who had a different than normal build, basing fat content off simple height and weight is ludicrous - may as well go back to the ideal weight charts of the 40s.   <br /> <br />It also takes a fair amount of time to enter this info, and it is not possible to my knowledge to just weigh yourself without entering it.  If I seem to be ranting, it is recalling the time I spent each morning for a year uselessly entering all this info in. <br /> <br />The fat % indicator would jump around between 18% and 45% for me, and even stepping off and reweighing myself 5 minutes later would result in weight discrepancies of up to 5 pounds at times.  Occasionally it would even say I had under 10% body fat, which I believe even less than the possibility I have 45% body fat. <br /> <br />When I finally measured myself with a balance it turned out the scale was 10 pounds off on average.  Simply pathetic. <br /> <br />I eventually got a taylor scale without the fat monitoring, and weighing myself several times in a row always gives me the exact same results, and it seems to honestly be within .2 pounds of the weight I get by using a calibrated balance at the doctor's office. <br /> <br />Overall this has to be one of my worst purchases of all time.",12643.0

I read various reviews about the Dr. Scholls Premium Foot spa and bought into it. It seemed like a really good product that would be beneficial. Now, the TRUTH: The day it arrived I attempted to use it. I read the instructions etc. and filled it with water. What happened, you may wonder? Well, I turned it on, and yes, it did vibrate. It also warmed up the water after a good 10-15 minutes after I had already put in luke warm water. So yes, it did what it \\""claims\\"".<br />  Now. Would I recommend that anyone but this? NEVER! Don't even think once about it! The thing has the noise level equal to a vacuum, but truthfully my vacuum has more power to it. If you want to see what this product would be like, I encourage you to get a pan and fill it with warm water. Next, get a few straws. Stick your feet in it, and blow bubbles into the water with the straws. That \\""movement\\"" of water, and the speed at which you can blow is ironically almost the exact speed as the Premium Foot Spa! The vibration option is like setting your foot on a cell phone that is vibrating. When the bubbles and massage are used in combination, the effects of both, which are none-the-less minimally--MINIMALLY--stimulating, can be thought of as cancelling eachother out. You can feel them, but have no idea which is which. NOT IMPRESSED. You could easily forget that you have your feet in a tub of water. I tried it once again to ensure that the air pressure wasn't building up or that I was too impatient, but no. I waited for 15 minutes for something more than a pathetic purring but nothing happened. If you have a pool, stick your foot in and swirl it around, it could even be more pleasing as well as cheaper.<br />  My last issue: splashing water. In vibration mode, it doesn't splash- it barely does anything! In option 2, bubble mode, it splashed pretty much everywhere after a good 10 minutes.(*I also checked that water level twice to ensure it wasn't too high and even took some water out!) The machine causes little splashes to go everywhere around it. It was more stressful to watch all the water I would have to clean up at the end of this \\""relaxing\\"" foot \\""treatment\\"". I also have to mention that the cord was also continuously getting wet. Not only from the splashes, but because one of the foot placements that has rollers in which you have to roll your feet over, makes water spill out the back sides and the cord outlet is conviently right on that back side! The foot pieces I also have to mention are nothing but plastic. They are  very dificult to feel, if felt at all. The rollers also besides the splashing are sompletely ineffective. The accupressure/node whatever, is located in the worst possible spot, the center. It is not even in the water, but raised about it! So out of warm water into cold air and then continuous rubbing of one foot at a time on a piece of plastic which your foot doesn't exactly fit into the area causes an uncomfortable and feelingless waste of time.<br />I couldn't tell anyone to buy this, and quite frankly, you should be paid not to.

The Braun is clumsy, difficult to adjust and tricky to turn on, which involves pulling the beard guard up just enough to activate the on switch at your beard length setting without pulling the guard off of the trimmer since there is no stop.  It has a swiveling head which means that the head is not firmly attached to the trimmer.  When you pull up too far on the beard guard to turn it on or change the length setting you can pull off not only the guard but the head also, which then drops down on the floor or if you are unlucky on your foot.  It is sharp and it hurts, by the way. The Braun does not do the fine even trimming that the Norelco does, but leaves sort of randomly long hairs.  The beard guard is bulky so you cannot get as close to your nose and ears as you might like.  Compared to the top line Norelco it is a dismal failure but at least you won't have to worry about it too long since you will doubtless break the head by inadvertently pulling it off with the beard guard.
